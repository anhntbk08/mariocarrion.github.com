Final.</div><div class=markdown><p>I've been using this tablet for about 4 months with OpenSUSE 11.1, I'm happy: performance, design and hardware support are good for me, however there are few complaints about it:<h3>Hardware</h3><ul><li>Keys are small. Are not small as keys in netbooks, but you get tired if you spent more that 6 hours hacking.<li>Temperature. This is really painful, the hard-disk gets really warm and you can't touch the bottom if you are using doing hard work.<li>Noise. Same as temperature, using the DVD is somehow annoying, unless you are wearing headphones you don't notice the noise. When using the hard-disk, for example, compiling or searching, happens the same.</ul><p>Recently noticed that HP released <strong>HP TouchSmart tx2z</strong>, this is similar to TX2500z, however the big differences include more memory (up to 8gb) and multi-touch support. Hopefully my complains are already fixed in this newest hardware.<h3>Software</h3><p>Installing OpenSUSE 11.1 in super easy, so installing won't let you down, however you will need <em>extra tunning</em> if you want to support all hardware, in particular <a href=http://smolts.org/smolt-wiki/pci/1002/4383/103c/30f1>sound</a>, <a href=http://smolts.org/smolt-wiki/pci/14e4/432b/103c/137f>wireless</a> and video:<h4>radeonhd, open driver</h4><p>1.2.3 is installed by default, this version doesn't support Screen Rotation nor 3D Acceleration, according to <a href=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-December/041464.html>1.2.4 releasing notes</a> Screen Rotation is now supported however xrandr doesn't report any rotation information. If you want to upgrade add the following repository and upgrade:<br><code lang=genero>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/Drivers:/Video/openSUSE_11.1/</code>.<h4>fglrx, proprietary driver</h4><p>I recommend to generate the rpm and use zypper to install the generated file, if you are running 64bit you will need to <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1019712">recreate the symbolic link</a> because seems the fglrx driver is using 32 paths instead of 64, according to <a href=http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Features>documentation</a> Screen Rotation is also supported, but not enabled by default, so execute as root:<br><code lang=genero>aticonfig --set-pcs-str="DDX,EnableRandr12,TRUE"</code><br>to enable it, notice this command doesn't change <em>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</em>, it works however sometimes rotating the screen will lead to a black screen.<h3>Verdict</h3><p>I like it, is smaller and lighter that my previous laptop, however the temperature is <strong>really really annoying</strong>.</div></div></div></section>
