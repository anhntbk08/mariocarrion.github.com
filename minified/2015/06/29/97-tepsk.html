Should I be worried?<p>I must say that <em>97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</em> includes some cool tips, some of them pretty obvious if you have been doing this for a while, but still a great reading if you are starting and don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience.<p>I would be lying if I don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t like some of the tips, but the truth is I did, as a matter of fact the following were my favorite:<ul><li><strong>Hard work does not pay off</strong> by <a href=http://olvemaudal.com/>Olve Maudal</a> which basically means: make all your <em>work time</em> useful, staying late to finish your job is not what you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing, be focused and stop fooling around.<li><strong>Testing is the Engineering Rigor of Software Development</strong> by <a href=http://nealford.com/>Neal Ford</a>. I personally like this one a lot, because sadly is not one of the things you learn at school&hellip; or maybe you do nowadays. The idea is simple: test <strong>always</strong>. Testing is often consider a <em>last thing to do</em> because silly people know nothing about Software Engineering.<li><strong>Write code as if you had to support for the rest of your life</strong> by <a href=http://www.yuriy-zubarev.com/>Yuriy Zubarev</a>. Pretty straightforward and honestly really obvious, when writing code, write it like you mean it. Think: <em>what if I have to revisit this code in a few months&hellip; or years?</em>. Simple thing that a lot of developers don&rsquo;t care.</ul><p>I liked those the most because is stuff that is extremely obvious but a lot of &ldquo;<em>engineers</em>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t think of; basic stuff, because not everything is about the programming language or the algorithms or the frameworks you use for creating software, but it&rsquo;s more about the human aspect of writing software, because in the end people writing software are <em>still</em> humans.<p>Next in the queue is <strong>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer</strong>, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to reading this one because I personally like a lot about Software Design and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll learn something useful, not only for my Ruby projects, but in general for all the software I write in the future.<br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
