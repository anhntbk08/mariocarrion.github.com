Should I be worried?<p>I must say that <em>97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</em> includes some cool tips, some of them pretty obvious if you have been doing this for a while, but still a great reading if you are starting and don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience.<p>I would be lying if I don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t like some of the tips, but the truth is I did, as a matter of fact the following were my favorite:<ul><li><strong>Hard work does not pay off</strong> by <a href=http://olvemaudal.com/>Olve Maudal</a> which basically means: make all your <em>work time</em> useful, staying late to finish your job is not what you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing, be focused and stop fooling around.<li><strong>Testing is the Engineering Rigor of Software Development</strong> by <a href=http://nealford.com/>Neal Ford</a>. I personally like this one a lot, because sadly is not one of the things you learn at school&hellip; or maybe you do nowadays. The idea is simple: test <strong>always</strong>. Testing is often consider a <em>last thing to do</em> because silly people know nothing about Software Engineering.<li><strong>Write code as if you had to support for the rest of your life</strong> by <a href=http://www.yuriy-zubarev.com/>Yuriy Zubarev</a>. Pretty straightforward and honestly really obvious, when writing code, write it like you mean it. Think: <em>what if I have to revisit this code in a few months&hellip; or years?</em>. Simple thing that a lot of developers don&rsquo;t care.</ul><p>I liked those the most because is stuff that is extremely obvious but a lot of &ldquo;<em>engineers</em>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t think of; basic stuff, because not everything is about the programming language or the algorithms or the frameworks you use for creating software, but it&rsquo;s more about the human aspect of writing software, because in the end people writing software are <em>still</em> humans.<p>Next in the queue is <strong>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer</strong>, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to reading this one because I personally like a lot about Software Design and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll learn something useful, not only for my Ruby projects, but in general for all the software I write in the future.</div><div id=related><h3>Posts</h3><ul class=posts><li><a href=/archive.html#2015>All posts this year 2015</a></ul><ul class=posts><li><span>Jun 23, 2015</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2015/06/23/books-mid-year-update.html>Mid 2015 Books Update</a><li><span>Jul 01, 2015</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2015/07/01/dirty-associations.html>Tip: Dirty Associations with Active Record</a></ul></div><div class=footer><div class=disclaimer><p>The postings on this site are my own and do not represent my
