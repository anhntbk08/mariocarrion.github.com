It&rsquo;s frustrating and encouraging at the same time because you have the solution in your head but putting it in <em>words</em> it&rsquo;s more difficult. The best analogy I can think of this experience would be ordering food in a foreign country where the language you speak is not spoken by the locals. Simple as that. You&rsquo;re hungry, you know what you want to eat but you can&rsquo;t express it in proper words, you need to use your hands, maybe draw a couple of things, ask for help, etcetera, etcetera, and all of that takes time.<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how it went.<ul><li>Preparing my Dockerfiles for statically building a go binary was easy, until I started having issues with <a href=https://github.com/gographics/imagick>imagick</a>, which so far I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out.<li>Making sure everything was 100% covered, again took me some time, not because the packages <a href=https://golang.org/pkg/testing/>testing</a> and <a href=https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/>net/http/httptest</a> are difficult to use but more because I had to properly write the code in a way it allowed <a href=https://tour.golang.org/methods/4>interfaces</a> so I could mock the things I needed to to properly test everything.</ul><p>In the end, this new project is still a work in progress and it is not ready for production, I believe I will need at least another sprint to finally have it ready, and the truth is that I haven&rsquo;t had enough time to consider the production-specific problems, like deployment, monitoring, logging and whatnot.<p>In all honesty I&rsquo;m enjoying programming, <strong>a lot</strong>, in Go and using Docker is a <strong>delight</strong>. I know everything is taking longer than expected, but that&rsquo;s the way it is when building and using something new. However I know one thing for sure: this sprint is going be much more amazing.</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
