After doing it I started getting the following errors after executing <code>bundle install</code>:<pre class=black-pre>

There is a chance you are experiencing a man-in-the-middle attack, but most likely your system doesn't have the CA certificates needed for verification. For information about OpenSSL certificates, see http://bit.ly/ruby-ssl. To connect without using SSL, edit your Gemfile sources and change 'https' to 'http'.

</pre><p>Obviously this implied that everything related to rubygem was not working because <code>gem install bundler</code> was also throwing:<pre class=black-pre>
ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'bundler' (>= 0), here is why:
Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/ - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (https://api.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)
</pre><p>The SSL certificates on my work computer where obviously busted and because remote environments worked fine there was no blaming Rubygems this time. Google helped me find some possible answers:<ol><li>Replace <strong>https</strong> with <strong>http</strong><li>Manually download <a href=https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88#manual-solution-to-ssl-issue>the certificate</a> and apply it<li>Use <code>rvm osx-ssl-certs update all</code></ol><p>I didn&rsquo;t even consider trying the first suggestion, obvious reasons; the second and third option did not work, so before going all nuclear I decided to try one last thing:<p><code>brew install openssl</code><p>And that fixed the whole thing! It only took me about 40 minutes to fix, what a waste of time. Fixing this issue retaught me two things:<ol><li>Do you have something important to do today? <strong>Do not</strong> think about updating your computer.<li>Dockerize all your world, at least the problems will be reduced to something in the container, not your computer; most of the times.</ol></div><div id=related><h3>Posts</h3><ul class=posts><li><a href=/archive.html#2016>All posts this year 2016</a></ul><ul class=posts><li><span>Oct 01, 2016</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2016/10/01/october-goals.html>Goals: October 2016</a><li><span>Oct 06, 2016</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2016/10/06/go-web-programming.html>Finished Reading: Go Web Programming</a></ul></div><div class=footer><div class=disclaimer><p>The postings on this site are my own and do not represent my
