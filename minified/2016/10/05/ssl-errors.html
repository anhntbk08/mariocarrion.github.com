After doing it I started getting the following errors after executing <code>bundle install</code>:<pre class=black-pre>

There is a chance you are experiencing a man-in-the-middle attack, but most likely your system doesn't have the CA certificates needed for verification. For information about OpenSSL certificates, see http://bit.ly/ruby-ssl. To connect without using SSL, edit your Gemfile sources and change 'https' to 'http'.

</pre><p>Obviously this implied that everything related to rubygem was not working because <code>gem install bundler</code> was also throwing:<pre class=black-pre>
ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'bundler' (>= 0), here is why:
Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/ - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (https://api.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)
</pre><p>The SSL certificates on my work computer where obviously busted and because remote environments worked fine there was no blaming Rubygems this time. Google helped me find some possible answers:<ol><li>Replace <strong>https</strong> with <strong>http</strong><li>Manually download <a href=https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88#manual-solution-to-ssl-issue>the certificate</a> and apply it<li>Use <code>rvm osx-ssl-certs update all</code></ol><p>I didn&rsquo;t even consider trying the first suggestion, obvious reasons; the second and third option did not work, so before going all nuclear I decided to try one last thing:<p><code>brew install openssl</code><p>And that fixed the whole thing! It only took me about 40 minutes to fix, what a waste of time. Fixing this issue retaught me two things:<ol><li>Do you have something important to do today? <strong>Do not</strong> think about updating your computer.<li>Dockerize all your world, at least the problems will be reduced to something in the container, not your computer; most of the times.</ol><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-75640250-1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
