<a href=/><i class="home fa fa-home"></i></a><h1 class=title>A look back at the previous lustrum.</h1><div id=post><p>Five days ago Facebook reminded me, thanks to the <a href=https://www.facebook.com/help/439014052921484/>On This Day</a> feature, about my first blog related to the <a href=/2010/01/21/the-ruby-programming-language.html>Ruby Programming Language</a>.<p>This first blog post was written five years ago.<p>What I take from that reminder is not only the fact that Ruby is the programming language I&rsquo;ve been using professionally and personally the most, but also the fact that I haven&rsquo;t learned anything new, and that makes me a little sad.<p>By that I don&rsquo;t mean <em>anything</em> new, of course I have learned a lot of things during this last five years. I don&rsquo;t mean that, I mean <strong>something</strong> I personally wanted to learn. Something that inspired me to write a bunch of code in my free time, to get involved with whatever community surrounding that new thing, stuff like that, basically doing something outside my regular obligatory daily job.<p>Granted <strong>great</strong> personal things happened to me in the last five years and having some personal free time was difficult. However that is not a real excuse, in the end I believe if you really want to do something you&rsquo;ll find the way to do it.<p>The truth is that I didn&rsquo;t start having these thoughts 5 days ago, I&rsquo;ve been trying to improve myself since last year, but for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t really have a real opportunity to do so.<p>As a matter of fact, I can consider 2015 as the year that started the ball rolling, because in 2015 I was able to read <strong>20</strong> new technical books, which is really nothing compared to what I used to read when I was in college, but again, that&rsquo;s a significant improvement from previous years.<p>So far this 2016, I already read 2, slow start that&rsquo;s for sure but I&rsquo;m confident my previous year record will be broken. I already made a list of the books I want to complete, the list so far contains <strong>66</strong> technical books, which is a lot if you compare it to 2015, but hey daily commuting takes me at least 40 minutes and I can&rsquo;t let that free time to go to waste.</div><div id=related><h3>Posts</h3><ul class=posts><li><a href=/archive.html#2016>All posts this year 2016</a></ul><ul class=posts><li><span>Jan 22, 2016</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2016/01/22/fixing-mysql-postgresql-upgrades.html>Tip: From MySQL to PostgreSQL</a><li><span>Feb 01, 2016</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2016/02/01/febraury-2016-goals.html>Goals: February 2016</a></ul></div><div class=footer><div class=disclaimer><p>The postings on this site are my own and do not represent my
