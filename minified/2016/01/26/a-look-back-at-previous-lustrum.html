I don&rsquo;t mean that, I mean <strong>something</strong> I personally wanted to learn. Something that inspired me to write a bunch of code in my free time, to get involved with whatever community surrounding that new thing, stuff like that, basically doing something outside my regular obligatory daily job.<p>Granted <strong>great</strong> personal things happened to me in the last five years and having some personal free time was difficult. However that is not a real excuse, in the end I believe if you really want to do something you&rsquo;ll find the way to do it.<p>The truth is that I didn&rsquo;t start having these thoughts 5 days ago, I&rsquo;ve been trying to improve myself since last year, but for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t really have a real opportunity to do so.<p>As a matter of fact, I can consider 2015 as the year that started the ball rolling, because in 2015 I was able to read <strong>20</strong> new technical books, which is really nothing compared to what I used to read when I was in college, but again, that&rsquo;s a significant improvement from previous years.<p>So far this 2016, I already read 2, slow start that&rsquo;s for sure but I&rsquo;m confident my previous year record will be broken. I already made a list of the books I want to complete, the list so far contains <strong>66</strong> technical books, which is a lot if you compare it to 2015, but hey daily commuting takes me at least 40 minutes and I can&rsquo;t let that free time to go to waste.</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-75640250-1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
