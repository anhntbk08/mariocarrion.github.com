I don't know if the time spent there and the time which I spent at the Xico's church has some meaning, does that means something? Do I need to get closer to the church? We don't know... yet.<br>Then, when the Mass at the church was finished I met some other relatives of my girlfriend, my father-in-law didn't come so I obviously didn't meet him, yet.<p>Later at the party, I danced like a crazy, I need to practice... I don't even remember the basic salsa's steps. Like many other parties, the noise was awful and you can't talk, I was wondering all the night: "What did you say? Would you repeat it?", but I spent a very good time, I always enjoy being with her.<p>Everything was good, I felt a few sad when I noticed that she might be at other city far away from here... when she starts her job, I also felt sad because I wasn't there... I mean, I haven't finished my studies, I need 1 and a half year more... and later? I've finished, And NOW... what?!<br>I don't have to spend too much time wasting my thoughts about that... (first) I need to finish MonoUML, which now has its first cvs update... check it out NOW! or <a href=http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/monouml>browse it online</a> thanks to Rodolfo for his excelent work, I'll now start to code the MonoUML's widget, keep in touch!<p>I learned today: 'Don't get sad, it's too soon! Get sad later, after finishing MonoUML. Be happy run Linux!'<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div></div></div></div></section>
