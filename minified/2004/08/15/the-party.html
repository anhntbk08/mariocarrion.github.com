<a href=/><i class="home fa fa-home"></i></a><h1 class=title>The Party</h1><div id=post><div style=clear:both></div><p>I spent almost 10 hours at all the party-process, (I had fun), first I went to the church (I promised to don't go to any church before my wedding, now the promise is broken, again, I broke it earlier when I went to Xico... now I'm a promise-broker who doesn't keep his promises), then there, at the church, I spent a lot of time watching all the religious figures and thinking about them, I didn't know how to behave there, I didn't know what to say, I spent almost 1 hour doing everything by repeating as a monkey, I was a <a href=http://www.mono-project.com>mono</a>. I don't know if the time spent there and the time which I spent at the Xico's church has some meaning, does that means something? Do I need to get closer to the church? We don't know... yet.<br>Then, when the Mass at the church was finished I met some other relatives of my girlfriend, my father-in-law didn't come so I obviously didn't meet him, yet.<p>Later at the party, I danced like a crazy, I need to practice... I don't even remember the basic salsa's steps. Like many other parties, the noise was awful and you can't talk, I was wondering all the night: "What did you say? Would you repeat it?", but I spent a very good time, I always enjoy being with her.<p>Everything was good, I felt a few sad when I noticed that she might be at other city far away from here... when she starts her job, I also felt sad because I wasn't there... I mean, I haven't finished my studies, I need 1 and a half year more... and later? I've finished, And NOW... what?!<br>I don't have to spend too much time wasting my thoughts about that... (first) I need to finish MonoUML, which now has its first cvs update... check it out NOW! or <a href=http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/monouml>browse it online</a> thanks to Rodolfo for his excelent work, I'll now start to code the MonoUML's widget, keep in touch!<p>I learned today: 'Don't get sad, it's too soon! Get sad later, after finishing MonoUML. Be happy run Linux!'<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div></div><div id=related><h3>Posts</h3><ul class=posts><li><span>All in 2016!</span> <a href=/archive.html#2004>All posts from this year</a></ul><ul class=posts><li><span>Aug 13, 2004</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2004/08/13/and-then-tomorrow.html>And then tomorrow...</a><li><span>Aug 16, 2004</span> <a href=http://www.mariocarrion.com/2004/08/16/sad.html>Sad</a></ul></div><div class=footer><div class=disclaimer><p>The postings on this site are my own and do not represent my
