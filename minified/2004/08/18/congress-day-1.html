The second a Doctor from <a href=http://www.digipen.edu>DIGIPEN</a> talked about the games and how they are written, they use DirectX and OpenGL for rendering... I didn't asked something but they may be using Windows (I hope not), by the way... at his conference his laptop hanged due to some weird and unusual Windows Media Bug X). I didn't like the third conference, the girl was reading something about e-libraries. The last one, the fourth, it was too good, a russian Dr, who spoke in spanish, talked about the Natural Language Processing, too good.<p>I saw (also today) the movie King Arthur, is good, it is like the Braveheart movie, it's good, you must see it.<p><span style=font-weight:700>I learned today:</span> 'There's nothing better than a Unix-based Operating System (AKA. *BSD, *Linux)'<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
