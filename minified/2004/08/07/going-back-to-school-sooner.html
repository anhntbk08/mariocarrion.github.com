After being at the school I went to buy some book which <a href=http://expertcoder.sf.net>rodolfo</a> suggest me, it is called "UML. Gota a gota", but I didn't find it, then I went to another library and I didn't find it either. The book may be too good, maybe tomorrow I'll buy the UML's "Tres Amigos" book, rodolfo said that it may be good and due to he is the guy with most experience about UML in the team I should trust him, I'm going to take some pictures, I need them for some papers at school. By the way, I'm updating the <a href=http://monouml.sf.net>MonoUML</a>'s webpage, graphic design is too difficult for me, I don't like that, I'm rough! and I don't have enough time for thinking, any help? I need to rest, but I don't feel tired, any good sleeping pills?<p>I learned today: '6 or 7 subjects? What do you think?'<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
