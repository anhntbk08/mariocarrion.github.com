I've been recently dreaming about her, almost every night. I feel a few sad, why? I don't know, maybe some going-back-to-school-symptoms... I quit starting to code the MonoUML's UML2 widgets because of my feelings... I guess I'm depressed, reasons? I don't know... I hope to solve this quickly, I'm not a kind of depessed-guy.<p>I'll try to stop posting contens about myself. When I started to write this weblog my main goal was writing everything about my projects, not about myself, but nowadays I've been writing a lot of things which I've been feeling...<p>By the way, I recently saw the movie "There's something about Mary", it's old I know, I haven't seen it, but a like its soundtrack, here is the lyric of "How to Survive a Broken Heart" song:<p><span style=font-style:italic>And there's nothing left<br>But a song or two<br>That mean not a thing<br>If I can't play them for you<br>If I could hear your voice just one more time<br>Maybe I'd be fine</span><p>Complete lyric <a href=http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/theressomethingaboutmary/howtosurviveabrokenheart.htm>here</a>. There are a lot of more good songs in the <a href=http://www.stlyrics.com/t/theressomethingaboutmary.htm>soundtrack</a>, I encourage to listen them.<p>Oh man! Now I'm a pinche poet and I have feelings (again?)... what's going whith me? Answer: I need to go back to school.<p><span style=font-weight:700>I learned today:</span> 'Nice dreams, nice thoughts, nice life, nice girl; those all things make your life happier.'<br><span style=font-weight:700><br>By the way:</span> I'm hearing some romantic songs... I need some beers, I really do. Don't tell anyone but I guess I'm in lo**<p><span style=font-weight:700>Second By the way:</span> The "Curse of the Graduation Party" is broken. Don't ask about the details.<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div></div></div></div></section>
