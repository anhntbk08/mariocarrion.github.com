I don't miss any of Microsoft Windows' features. I miss the computer games, but nowadays I don't have enough time to play so I don't miss them either.<p>Recently, <span style=font-weight:700>the MonoUML Team</span>, had been thinking about writing our own diagramming canvas, due to diacanvas-sharp is still too immature for our purposes, we decided to choose GnomeCanvas, Mario Fuentes and I will code all those elements, new core elements will be written. Rodolfo added a new document <span style=font-weight:700>ARCHITECTURE</span>, he wrote it and I made the DocBook, it shows the core elements used in MonoUML, nice for those new people who will help sometime and useful for us too.<p><span style=font-weight:700>I learned today</span>: 'I'm going to travel in 2 hour and I haven't slept yet.'<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
