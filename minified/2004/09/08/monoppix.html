And I've found a nice project about mono bassed on the Knoppix release, it is called <a href=http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2004/09/01/223945.aspx>Monoppix</a>, it is a knoppix-based live-cd which ships mono including monodevelop, monodoc and xsp. Look <a href=http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/articles/220055.aspx>this page</a> for watching some nice screenshots.<p>I haven't done too much (recently) about MonoUML, I'll work with it sooner. Have fun with Monoppix.<p><span style=font-weight:700>I learned today:</span> 'I need to rest and I need a laptop and I need one new desktop computer and I need some money and I need more free time'<div style=clear:both;padding-bottom:.25em></div><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
