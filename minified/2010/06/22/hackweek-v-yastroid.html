The interaction is basically like this (see the <a href=http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Web/Architecture>detailed diagram</a> to get more information):<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/4725368064/ title="WebYaST by Mario Carrion, on Flickr"><img src=http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1203/4725368064_2e9b9b8c0e.jpg width=181 height=305 alt=WebYaST class=aligncenter></a><p>WebYaST and YaSTroid communicate using the <a href=http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Web/Development/REST_Service_Documentation>REST API</a>. If you have installed WebYaST you can access the documentation locally using:<pre><a href=http://localhost/restdoc>http://localhost/restdoc</a></pre><p>This website should show you a list of available methods and their arguments, if any, and examples showing you how to use them and the data returned. Pretty straightforward. Is also good idea to read the <a href=http://gitorious.org/opensuse/yast-rest-service>source code</a> in case the documentation is missing. Everything is written in Ruby, so it should really simple to read.<h3>Getting YaSTroid</h3><p>Developing YaSTroid requires having <a href=http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>Eclipse and Android</a> installed. After that clone the repository. Make sure you are using Android 1.5 when defining your virtual device.<pre>git clone git@gitorious.org:opensuse/yastroid.git</pre><h3>Result</h3><p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/4724778779/ title="WebYaST + YaSTroid by Mario Carrion, on Flickr"><img src=http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1030/4724778779_8956a64b5f_m.jpg width=240 height=127 alt="WebYaST + YaSTroid" class=aligncenter></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/4725501446/ title="WebYaST + YaSTroid by Mario Carrion, on Flickr"><img src=http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1200/4725501446_c826ac04d4_m.jpg width=240 height=126 alt="WebYaST + YaSTroid" class=aligncenter></a><p>Stephen and Scott recorded a video demoing the application using a real device, I recommend watching it full-screen to see all details.<p>If you can&rsquo;t see the embedded video <a href="http://www.novell.com/common/flash/play.php?media=http://cdn.novell.com/cached/video/2010/misc/yastroid.flv">follow this link</a>.<h3>Useful links</h3><ul><li><a href=http://www.decriptor.com/2010/06/22/yastroid/>YaSTroid</a> by Stephen Shaw<li><a href=http://en.opensuse.org/YaST>YaST - openSUSE</a></ul></p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
