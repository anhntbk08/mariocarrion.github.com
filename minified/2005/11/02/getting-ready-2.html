I'm only to one step to finish everything and I'm very happy about it.<p>On past monday I installed <a href=http://www.mono-project.com>mono</a> in one of the servers at my U, there are running <a href=http://fedora.redhat.com/>Fedora Core</a>-based servers, they obviouslly choose that distribution because of older Red Hat experience, anyway I just don't like rpms. <a href=http://www.go-mono.com/download/fedora-3-i386/>Installing mono</a> was easy as usual, but I'm still wondering if I need to install mono from <a href=http://go-mono.com/sources/>sources</a>... I don't know (yet) if this lastest built rpms fixes some <em>System.Web</em> issues if not I will gacutil it.<p>I set up <a href=http://www.mono-project.com/Mod_mono>mod_mono</a> for Apache and I did a simple Hello World test... everything worked! I'll install my system tomorrow in the morning. And then lets start testing it online.<p>After reading some articles from the <a href=http://www.mono-project.com>Mono Project</a> page I'm thinking about translating them to spanish, there is a lot of important information written there, and the most important: <em>working</em> and <em>recent</em> information.<p>I also need to do some other thing such as finishing <em>MonoCanvas</em> implementation, I haven't done the third draft... this third one might be the last one for starting our final implementation. Things to finish are fewer every day.</div></div></div></section>
