It looks fishy after you see that lots of your friends liked that link. Is a really good meme or a trick. Anyway after googling <em>victorialinn@live.com</em> (the email included in the source code of the page) I found an <a href=http://blog.kotowicz.net/2010/10/dont-textinfo-fightingguyinfo-facebook.html>interesting analysis</a> of all this. It is so fascinating. Take your time to read that blog. Is really interesting.<p><em>Disclaimer: I would lie to you by saying I didn't click it. I did it indeed. Naughty Mario I shouldn't had clicked it. But hey I'm a man!! The photo was depicting a schoolgirl. I had to click it!! :)</em></p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
