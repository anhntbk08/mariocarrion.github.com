Let's get the facts:<p>Even you were UNIX programmer you know the <em>DLL definition</em>, you understand that as a library, simple and normal shared library, forget the <em>dynamic</em> and all the bullshit, library nothing else, but in the Windows-world this isn't true all the time, Why? because of Microsoft's technologies. So, there are two kind of DLL libraries: Standard and ActiveX. Differences? Many MS Windows programmers love to use ActiveX-based libraries (they are also called Ole/COM/whatever... there's a long history about that... get any COM Book for getting the uncensored history) because those integrate MS programming languages in a easy way.. or at least they sell that idea, and yes.. sometimes is better doing the job than doing it well.<p>However, lets be good people and think nice. Ok, I accept the COM technology, looks nice, (better CORBA, however)... but, Why the hell those programmers decided to use that technology?!!? Didn't they think in the future? What about cross-platform compatibility? Ok, nice, use MS Windows, use their technologies use everything... But at least... document your parametrs!? Yes I know... reverse engineering works... but documentation is better and better!!<p>Nowadays I program in any language (even Delphi), I'm not as I used to be, am getting paid and the work needs to be done. But using Visual Basic!? <strong>WTF!!</strong> VB just sucks, bad programming language, period. Learning it isn't difficult at all, the problem is when trying to do real things, not just "<em>forms</em>". I prefer Delphi... and I thought won't said it...<p>C++ rocks, and I will be trying until I get the solution. <em>I'm not a MS Windows programmer</em>, <em>I don't like Visual Basic</em> Sorry, I'm real developer.<p>... BTW I don't have personal issues, would VB considered as personal issue?</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-75640250-1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
