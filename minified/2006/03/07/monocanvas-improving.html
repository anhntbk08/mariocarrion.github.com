After thinking for a while I've decided to draw-only-those-who-need-drawing, not every shape, this, of course, will improve rendering and redrawing, will consume less resources and will allow a smoother canvas interface.<p>The idea is simple, but effective, sort when adding shapes, after unpressing mouse button reorder moved-shape/s, this for keeping an ordered shapes-drawn-list. BY doing this will allow us, first to get the shapes that are moved, then calculate who shapes need to be re-drawn and of course by using its position will be faster to know over wich shape we are. I'm still fighting with the improvement of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search>binary search</a> algorithm, but when finished, everything will be very smoother and better.</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
