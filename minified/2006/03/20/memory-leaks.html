However memory leaks aren't like that, I mean, not literally, because later of using the objects and setting them to be <em>finalized</em> takes too much time being released. I remember that same behavior in Java's GC when using <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/>JMF</a> and the solution was the same. Nodaways while doing final performance tests in my current development, at work, and I notice this behavior. The solution is simple: <em>System.GC.Collect(); System.GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers ();</em>, but it needs to be used carefully, calling that two sentences everytime increases CPU usage and of course reduces application performance. The idea of using the GC <strong>every time needed</strong> (NOT EVERY TIME) (lets say every minute) stops "<em>eating your memory</em>".</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
