&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) June 28, 2018 It is really crazy that today, 14 years and 2 days ago, I started blogging. My first post describes the naive idea of rewriting Blogger.
The &amp;ldquo;funny&amp;rdquo; thing is that a month later I would be completing an ActiveView-like library, written in PHP4 using the newly introduced support for classes, called HTML2PHP.</description></item><item><title>Go Tip: Code Coverage</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/06/20/code-coverage-in-go.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/06/20/code-coverage-in-go.html</guid><description>Code coverage in Go is included in the toolchain and it is as simple as appending -coverprofile to the usual go test command, kind of like using:
go test -coverprofile=cover.out &amp;lt;package-name&amp;gt; Assuming all tests pass, then you should get an output similar to:
ok &amp;lt;package-name&amp;gt; 0.046s coverage: &amp;lt;XY.Z&amp;gt;% of statements Where XY.Z is the actual code coverage percentage. Notice that the coverprofile file, cover.out, can be used for generating a more human friendly output, like HTML, with:</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: Talk like TED</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/05/25/talk-like-ted.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/05/25/talk-like-ted.html</guid><description>Just finished reading &amp;quot;Talk like TED&amp;quot;.

&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) May 11, 2018 Software Design X-Rays is a book written by Adam Tornhill and published by The Pragmatic Programmers in 2018.
I was interested in reading this book since I saw the Beta version a few months back, gladly my interest was rewarded and it did not disappoint. It left me with a new way of looking at Software Development and showed me a measurable way to look at bottleneck code and hot spots.</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: Architectural Patterns</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/30/architectural-patterns.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/30/architectural-patterns.html</guid><description>Just finished reading &amp;quot;Architectural Patterns&amp;quot;, last book of April. It covers a lot of Software Architecture-related patterns. Long read. pic.twitter.com/k0itAZuaED
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) April 30, 2018 Architectural Patterns is a long book written by Pethuru Raj, Anupama Raman and Harihara Subramanian. It was published by Packt in 2017 and it covers all kind of software patterns, from your well-known classic Software Design Patterns to the more general Enterprise Patterns, and includes as well some specific patterns applicable to SOA and Microservices.</description></item><item><title>GothamGo 2018</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/27/gotham-go-2018.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/27/gotham-go-2018.html</guid><description>I had a great time last time I went to Gotham Go in 2016, I went two days, first day was the Advanced Workshop and second day was the conferences day; sadly I missed it last year, but this year I was surprised they changed the dates, they moved it from fall to spring which aligned correctly to my busy schedule. I was really looking forward to attending this year.</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: Never Split the Difference</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/12/never-split-the-difference.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/12/never-split-the-difference.html</guid><description>Just completed &amp;quot;Never Split the Difference&amp;quot; Good book, I should re-read it again at least once a year. üòå pic.twitter.com/HoFkrQm58R
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) April 12, 2018 Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It is a book published in 2016 by HarperBusiness and written by Chriss Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator.
Never Split the Difference is an interesting book with a nice pacing, it includes a collection of well narrated stories that helps you understand how some concepts were discovered and how those allow you take the upper hand when negotiating.</description></item><item><title>Go Tip: Judging go-swagger with dredd</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/03/judge-go-swagger-with-dredd.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/04/03/judge-go-swagger-with-dredd.html</guid><description>Using go-swagger it&amp;rsquo;s great for automatically generating Swagger 2.0 documentation for your API from annotations in your code. It even includes a validator to make sure the generated swagger.json is valid:
swagger validate swagger.json However there&amp;rsquo;s a tiny thing about this generated file, even if the swagger.json (or Blueprint) file is 100% valid it may not represent your real implementation, think of typos, broken responses, missing parameters or incorrect status codes.</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: The TAO of Microservices</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/03/26/the-tao-of-microservices.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/03/26/the-tao-of-microservices.html</guid><description>Verschlimmbessern! (Quote from The Tao of Microservices) pic.twitter.com/5yId7FE9Tz
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) March 9, 2018 The TAO of Microservices is a relatively recent book written by Richard Rodger and published by Manning in December 2017. It takes a different approach than other books I read already about the same topic of Microservices because it focuses on a different paradigm: breaking down microservices based on their message interaction, which not surprisingly reminds me a lot of an AWS Product we are trying out.</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: Building Evolutionary Architectures</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/03/01/building-evolutionary-architectures.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/03/01/building-evolutionary-architectures.html</guid><description>Gift for me! ‚ÄúBuilding Evolutionary Architectures‚Äù üòå pic.twitter.com/PT88mTFkAp
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) December 29, 2017 Building Evolutionary Architectures is a book written by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons and Patrick Kua, it was published by O&amp;rsquo;Reilly in October 2017, it is a short and concise read. It somehow feels similar to Building Microservices, maybe because both books were written by ThoughtWorks employees.

Effective Go includes a nice brief introduction to this feature, I&amp;rsquo;m expanding that a bit.

Just finished reading &amp;quot;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&amp;quot; @intensivedata Long read but great book, highly recommended. https://t.co/xMn6RtBonj
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) February 13, 2018 I don&amp;rsquo;t regret buying it at all but I do regret buying the physical version instead of the kindle version because it is heavy!
Designing Data-Intensive Applications comes with the following subtitle: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Systems which perfectly describes the content of this book, it is a combination of theory and practice with concrete software examples.</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: The 10X Rule</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/02/11/the-10x-rule.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/02/11/the-10x-rule.html</guid><description>Nice short quote from ‚ÄúThe 10x Rule‚Äù pic.twitter.com/MJeFb9R1xb
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) January 30, 2018 That quote from The 10X Rule reminded me of both The Compound Effect and The ONE Thing. The 10X Rule differs to those two books because it mostly focuses on one single thing &amp;ldquo;Do everything 10x times&amp;rdquo;, yes plain and simple: &amp;ldquo;do 10x! Do 10X, DO 10X!!&amp;rdquo;. This premise is repeated intentionally, I presume, multiple times in the book.</description></item><item><title>Go Tip: Environment Variables</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/01/31/go-environment-variables.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/01/31/go-environment-variables.html</guid><description>In Go it is really easy to access environment variables, you literally import the os package and use the Gentenv function, kind of like this:
package main import ( &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; &amp;quot;os&amp;quot; ) func main() { fmt.Printf(&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m %s\n&amp;quot;, os.Getenv(&amp;quot;USER&amp;quot;)) } That definetly works, however if you are planning to build a Twelve Factor App you will need a little bit more than that. Not surprisingly there are already two cool packages (which I personally use) for accomplishing that: github.</description></item><item><title>Finished Reading: The Manager&#39;s Path</title><link>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/01/28/the-managers-path.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mariocarrion.com/2018/01/28/the-managers-path.html</guid><description>Just finished reading: ‚ÄúThe Manager‚Äôs Path‚Äù, a book I feel I will be reading again later this year. üëçüèΩ pic.twitter.com/cK8c7w0kBA
&amp;mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) January 28, 2018 Being a Technical Manager is tougher than being a Manager because it includes dealing with technical people and I know for sure we could be the most biased individuals out there, for better or worse.
Are Computer Programmers the most biased professionals? ü§î</description></item></channel></rss>
