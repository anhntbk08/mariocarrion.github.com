I was really looking forward to attending this year.<blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GothamGo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GothamGo</a> day!</p>&mdash; Mario Carrion (@mariocarrion) <a href="https://twitter.com/mariocarrion/status/989831249836625920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>Gotham Go 2018 <strong>did not dissapoint</strong> I attended only to the conferences this time and similar to last time the emcees were Steve Francia and Mark Bates, and just like in 2016 they did a <strong>phenomenal job</strong>. I could be wrong, but I feel like this time the event did not sell out, maybe because of the date? I&rsquo;m not sure, but I did see less people than last time.<p>One thing I did not like about Gotham Go is that I <em>did not win</em> the vinyl Gopher!! ðŸ˜† I&rsquo;ve been trying to get one but those are <strong>really</strong> limited edition, I was so close with my Bingo card.<p><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/41748790971/in/album-72157666298769767/><img src=https://farm1.staticflickr.com/867/41748790971_16852973cd_n.jpg alt="Example image"></a><p>The talks were great, I liked that some of them included personal stories, like Cassandra&rsquo;s and Amy&rsquo;s, and some others, like Ron&rsquo;s, showed things I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to work on, which in this case is working on embedded systems; if I have to select the <em>best</em> talk I&rsquo;d say that it was <em>Go For Information Displays</em> by Anthony Starks, such as an awesome presentation, it reminded me of my <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/monouml/>previous project</a> and it literally <em>came out of nowhere</em>; the runner up would be Mat&rsquo;s, <em>Things in Go I never use</em>, he&rsquo;s such a funny and clever guy, I do agree with all his points.<p>I took a <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/albums/72157666298769767>bunch of pictures</a> like last time as well, feel free to look around.</div></div></div></section>
