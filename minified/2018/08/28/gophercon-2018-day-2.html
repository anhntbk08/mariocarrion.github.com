The conferences day to put it someway (but was my second one!). I arrived early because I assumed the breakfast lines will be similar to the ones we had yesterday for lunch, and considering it was only &ldquo;half&rdquo; the expected attendees I really wanted to make sure I avoided not having enough food.<p>After having breakfast, and before the first talk, I was able to explore the exhibitors booths, I got some really cool Gopher pins from the Microsoft booth:<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/NBmNmN target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1857/30592546878_f5037d0755_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Azure Pins" title="GopherCon 2018 Azure Pins"></a><p>Then the conferences officially started, the first talk was <strong>The Scheduler Saga</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/kavya719>Kavya Joshi</a>, it was phenomenal, I recall watching her talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZlN0izeiY">about channels</a>, that one was great as well. Kavya as expected did a great job describing the internals of the scheduler, explaining everything in such simple terms.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/NBmNVU target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1887/30592548798_013bce4ea8_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 The Scheduler Saga" title="GopherCon 2018 The Scheduler Saga"></a><p>Next was <strong>An Over-Engineering Disaster with Macaroons</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/_tessr>Tess Rinearson</a>, I was a bit curious about this one since I read the agenda, and silly me I thought it was really about some obscure reference to the french cookies (doh!), but I quickly realized this <a href=https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub41892><em>macaroons</em></a> thing was a reference to the old well known <em>browser cookies</em>, I did learn something for sure.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/27Z7CLj target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1881/42653167770_992f127249_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Macaroons" title="GopherCon 2018 Macaroons"></a><p>Next, we got a surprise announcement from Russ Cox (via a video projected to all the audience) regarding Go 2 and the efforts to improve Error Handling and Generics. Interesting stuff:<div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=//www.youtube.com/embed/6wIP3rO6On8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>I took a long break to explore the other exhibitor booths, I was able to get more stickers and talk to some of them, the DataDog and BugSnag people were friendly and the registry solution by jFrog was really interesting.<p>After that I attended <strong>How Do you Structure your Go Apps</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/kasiazien>Kat Zien</a>, she covered some known ways to structure Go code, not surprisingly the one she seemed to recommend was the Onion/Hexagonal Architecure, also suggested by Peter yesterday.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/27Z7DA5 target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1896/42653170540_4dc3b448ce_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Structure Go Code" title="GopherCon 2018 Structure Go Code"></a><p>Then I went to attend <strong>Allocator Wrestling</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/_emfree_>Eben Freeman</a>, which described ways to write Go code so it <em>helps</em> the Garbage collector, plus some cool techniques for profiling code to measure and improve performance.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/27Z7rjS target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1851/42653129290_16b411f4f1_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Allocator Wrestling" title="GopherCon 2018 Allocator Wrestling"></a><p>After that I attended <strong>Rethinking Classical Concurrency Patterns</strong> by <a href=https://github.com/bcmills>Bryan C. Mills</a>, this one was quite interesting because it revisited all the common concurrency patterns in Go, Bryan went through the code snippets really quick so watching this talk again (a few times) is required for everything to sink in.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/2aEAP3C target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1897/44412722372_8ddd772e7c_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Rethinking Classical Concurrency Patterns" title="GopherCon 2018 Rethinking Classical Concurrency Patterns"></a><p>Finally the last talk was <strong>Computer Vision Using Go and OpenCV 3</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/deadprogram>Ron Evans</a>, I was already familiar with this one, Ron gave this talk at <a href=/2018/04/27/gotham-go-2018.html>GothamGo 2018</a>, again it did not disappoint.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/2aEAX1b target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1899/44412749142_3740d6e61a_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Computer Vision Using Go and OpenCV 3" title="GopherCon 2018 Computer Vision Using Go and OpenCV 3"></a><p>Next I took a tiny break to have dinner, then I attended the <em>Welcome Party</em> at the <a href=http://www.artscomplex.com/><strong>Denver Performing Arts Complex</strong></a>, I listened to the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=gopherconband&amp;lang=en">GopherCon band</a> and enjoyed a few drinks.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/29mBqDB target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1864/43552788445_6616f4da04_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 GopherBand" title="GopherCon 2018 GopherBand"></a><p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/29mByo4 target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1877/43552814455_2f1458f97c_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 GopherBand" title="GopherCon 2018 GopherBand"></a><p>What a fun day was Day 2, I must to say that.<br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
