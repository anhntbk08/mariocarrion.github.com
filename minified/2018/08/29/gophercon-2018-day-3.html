Obviously all the points she mentioned in her talk made a lot of sense from the Accessibility point of view, however what I found more interesting about this talk was how those points not only improve accessibility but also make the final code much more clearer and easier to understand, and how those recommendations are conventions in Go that are encouraged, like using short names for variables for example. Great talk.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/NBmLQw target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1862/30592541758_f60b4ded23_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Accessibility in Go" title="GopherCon 2018 Accessibility in Go"></a><p>Next I attended <strong>Going Serverless</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower>Kelsey Hightower</a>, this talk was about demonstrating how to write Serverless Functions in Google Cloud Platform. Kelsey went from the implementation, to testing to even integrating that new function with another GCP product for returning weather values. It was an interesting and fun talk.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/NBmMeN target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1868/30592543108_ce7a536dd7_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Going Serverless" title="GopherCon 2018 Going Serverless"></a><p>Next was <strong>Go in Debian</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/zekjur>Michael Stapelberg</a>, similar to <em>Accessibility in Go</em>, this one brought <a href=/2006/04/20/debian.html>good memories</a>. Michael described some of the programs used in Debian that are written in Go, he covered several Debian-related tasks that are relevant not only to people who are trying to become Go maintainers in Debian, but also to Go writers that want to one day have their programs included in Debian.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/2aJZdoB target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1857/44462359351_ebd97db480_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Go in Debian" title="GopherCon 2018 Go in Debian"></a><p>Next we had <strong>Becoming a Go Contributor</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/derivativeburke>Kevin Burke</a>. Kevin talked about how to contribute to Go, how every single contribution, no matter the size, is important. He gave a few tips, like starting with minimal contributions or adding more examples, work for initial contributions. One interesting thing about Kevin&rsquo;s talk was his suggestion about using the <a href=https://go.googlesource.com/scratch><em>scratch</em></a> repository for getting used to the contribution process, for practicing before submitting <em>real</em> pull requests.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/2aJZe6t target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1879/44462361721_50023f6cb5_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Becoming a Go Contributor" title="GopherCon 2018 Becoming a Go Contributor"></a><p>Next I attended <strong>From Prototype to Production</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/devalshah>Deval Shah</a>, he talked about Reddit&rsquo;s Ad Serving Platform, the lessons learned when implementing their platform, some of the problems they faced and their solutions. Really relevant talk.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/NBmNqq target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1890/30592547088_bfa78c1bed_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 From Prototype to Production" title="GopherCon 2018 From Prototype to Production"></a><p>Next was <strong>Designing Software Within Constraints</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/skriptble>Kris Brandow</a>. Kris shared with us his experience when implementing some of the MongoDB specifications, this reminded me when I was working with <a href=https://twitter.com/rcamperotuc>Rodolfo</a> implementing some of the UML specifications in <a href=/2007/07/01/numl-04.html>nUML</a>, most of the 12 suggestions resonated with me. I also liked his analogy of implementing specifications with following a recipe when baking cakes.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/29DxwZ7 target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1848/43744409744_3f04393ea0_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Designing Software Within Constraints" title="GopherCon 2018 Designing Software Within Constraints"></a><p>The last one, before the closing keynote, was <strong>C L Eye - Catching User Interfaces</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/jrbowes>James Bowes</a>. In this tutorial James showed us different ways, via escape codes, to manipulate the terminal to display characters in different colors, formats and sizes; James even showed us how to render images, he demonstrated some examples in different terminals and different OSs. Really interesting.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/2aJZfuF target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1848/44462366431_981b41be95_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 C L Eye Catching User Interfaces" title="GopherCon 2018 C L Eye Catching User Interfaces"></a><p>Finally the closing keynote: <strong>The Importance of Beginners</strong> by <a href=https://twitter.com/nataliepis>Natalie Pistunovich</a>. Natalie began her talk by sharing her story, how she got involved in the project, then she mentioned the numbers of Go users, how the Go community has quickly grown over last year. The main idea of the talk was to be inclusive and never be afraid of asking, and welcoming new people is a must (AKA Don&rsquo;t Be A Dick â„¢).<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/2aEANc9 target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1894/44412719502_53dee84a10_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 The Importance of Beginners" title="GopherCon 2018 The Importance of Beginners"></a><p>After that, Bryan and Erik broke the news! <strong>GopherCon 2019 will be in San Diego</strong>:<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/27Z7rsY target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1850/42653129760_9a9de9cc1b_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 GopherCon 2019" title="GopherCon 2018 GopherCon 2019"></a><p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to GopherCon 2019!</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/archive.html>Back to posts</a></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section>
