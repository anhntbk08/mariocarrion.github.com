The tour was a bit underwhelming because it takes too much waiting in line to see too little. But <em>beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers</em> I suppose, considering the whole thing is free (you only have to line up and wait for a bus) and it also includes some free beers at the end.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/LYYeMM target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1856/29524394227_901568ea98_n.jpg alt="Coors Brewery" title="Coors Brewery"></a><p>I&rsquo;d say the overall <a href=https://www.visitgolden.com/><em>Golden, Colorado</em></a> experience was <em>ok</em>, mostly because we were stuck trying to come back to Denver, Lyft drivers didn&rsquo;t want to bring us back, which in the end made us take a regular, and <strong>really expensive</strong>, cab to come back. We still like Lyft though.<p>To end on a high note our <em>zeroth</em> day we decided eat dinner out. We found a Mexican restaurant close to our hotel, walking distance actually, called: <a href=http://lalomamexican.com/><strong>La Loma</strong></a>. We did not know anything about it and, for a second time today, we were pleasantly surprised, nice food, good portions and not that expensive. Highly recommended.<p>In the end Sunday was fun and we enjoyed it. Looking forward to starting GopherCon week tomorrow!<h2 id=day-1>Day 1</h2><p>First day of GopherCon consisted in registering and attending the <em>Architecture &amp; Domain Modeling with Go kit</em> workshop by <a href=https://peter.bourgon.org/>Peter Bourgon</a>, the <em>default</em> swag we got for attending the conference is awesome.<p>There was a booth were you could buy more swag, I was able to <em>&ldquo;snatch&rdquo;</em> a Cowboy Gopher, some t-shirts and extra stickers for my crew, sadly I was not able to buy a hoodie, it looks like it was a pre-order only item, I will try later this week to see if there are more available.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/29mBs6z target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1842/43552793315_236fe12d1b_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 swag" title="GopherCon 2018 swag"></a><p>Regarding the workshop, it was a bit <em>click and bait-ish</em> because <a href=https://github.com/go-kit/kit>Go kit</a> was not really the focus of the workshop <strong>however</strong> I liked Peter&rsquo;s honesty, he was clear about it from the beginning and he mentioned it right away. In reality after completing the workshop I understood Peter&rsquo;s rationale. The workshop sole focus was to <em>architecture and design</em> services using <em>Domain Modeling</em>, and in the end it all made sense when Peter introduced Go kit to update the existing implementation of the project we were using for the workshop.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/NBmLKw target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1895/30592541468_59e0d0f42b_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Workshop" title="GopherCon 2018 Workshop"></a><p><strong>Great job by Peter</strong>.<p>We finished the workshop a bit early, that gave me a tiny window to rest, reset and have dinner with my family before going to the last stop of the day: <a href=https://www.meetup.com/Denver-Go-Language-User-Group/events/252219257/>Gophercon Pre-Party Meetup</a>. This meetup happened at <a href=https://twitter.com/sendgrid>SendGrip</a>, nice location, although because of the amount of people (100+ attendees) it was a bit hot, either way I learned a few tricks after listening to the talks, cool stuff.<p><a href=https://flic.kr/p/29mBswe target=_blank><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1864/43552794745_eb89aa1175_n.jpg alt="GopherCon 2018 Meetup at SendGrid" title="GopherCon 2018 Meetup at SendGrid"></a><p>Overall <strong>legit</strong> <em>first</em> day of GopherCon.
