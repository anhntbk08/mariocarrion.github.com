Five more months and 2017 will be gone. How crazy is that? [Last month]({{< relref "2017-07-01-july-goals.markdown" >}}) was a blur, I couldn't complete _everything_ I planned. _C'est la vie_.
 
### Professionally

I'm making excellent progress with the changes I planned. It kind of feels like those cooking shows where the ingredients are all over the place and in the end the final plate is displayed beautifully. I feel like August will be the best one regarding those new changes. I'll tell you in September.

### Personally

I started a new series of blog posts, something I like to call [_Building a Healthy Codebase_]({{< relref "2017-07-12-building-a-healthy-codebase.markdown" >}}). The principal idea is to share things I've learned (and keep learning) during my professional career, also I plan to include _bad practices_ as well.

Regarding my reading, sadly, I couldn't complete all the four books I planned, I did finish [The Obstacle is The Way]({{< relref "2017-07-11-the-obstacle-is-the-way.markdown" >}}) and [Streaming Data]({{< relref "2017-07-24-streaming-data.markdown" >}}), but could not complete the other two: I started _The Power of Habit_, really cool book by the way, also really long, and I haven't touched _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_.

### What am I planning for August 2017?

Complete those two books I meant to complete in July. I won't be adding new planned books to read but instead I want to work a bit on a personal project with Go and Redis, I'll share the progress when time comes.

August will be exciting.
