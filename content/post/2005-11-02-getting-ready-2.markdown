<p>I'll start working on next monday and I haven't yet finished my last report for <a href="http://www.itver.edu.mx">the University</a>, I won't have any more free time for doing it... yesterday I gave my preview to my counselor, I hope he accepts it. I'm only to one step to finish everything and I'm very happy about it.</p>
<p>On past monday I installed <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">mono</a> in one of the servers at my U, there are running <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core</a>-based servers, they obviouslly choose that distribution because of older Red Hat experience, anyway I just don't like rpms. <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download/fedora-3-i386/">Installing mono</a> was easy as usual, but I'm still wondering if I need to install mono from <a href="http://go-mono.com/sources/">sources</a>... I don't know (yet) if this lastest built rpms fixes some <em>System.Web</em> issues if not I will gacutil it. </p>
<p>I set up <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mod_mono">mod_mono</a> for Apache and I did a simple Hello World test... everything worked! I'll install my system tomorrow in the morning. And then lets start testing it online.</p>
<p>After reading some articles from the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono Project</a> page I'm thinking about translating them to spanish, there is a lot of important information written there, and the most important: <em>working</em> and <em>recent</em> information.</p>
<p>I also need to do some other thing such as finishing <em>MonoCanvas</em> implementation, I haven't done the third draft... this third one might be the last one for starting our final implementation. Things to finish are fewer every day.</p>
