February, the shortest month of the year, is gone, also what a crazy day was yesterday right? Specially for Amazon.

How was February 2017? I believe I failed what I tried to attempt, yes I was able to accomplish some of my personal goals but I did not complete all of them. I really underestimated February, I wanted to do too much and I failed. There's no shame in failing, there's a shame in not acknowledging your failures.

The key question here is: _what am I planning to change so I can succeed this time, this March 2017?_ Difficult question but I have some ideas.

### Professionally

I was able to write _yet another_ proprietary Ruby Gem, basically an API for interacting with a Web Service, the cool thing about this new gem is not the actual implementation but the testing-side of it: the idea of sharing the [VCR Cassettes]({{< relref "2017-02-06-vcr-webmock.markdown" >}}) for properly testing code using that said gem from a different project.

Besides that Ruby project I had the opportunity to write some client-side JavaScript, using a combination of jQuery and KnockoutJS. JavaScript is not something I see myself doing everyday but still, from time to time, it helps a bit the change of scenery. I even blogged about the [KnockoutJS bindings]({{< relref "2017-02-09-knockout-jquery-binding-handlers.markdown" >}}) I learned while implementing this new change.

### Personally

I completed half of the books I planned to read, _2 of 4_:

* [Building the Web of Things]({{< relref "2017-02-16-web-of-things.markdown" >}})
* [Go Programming Blueprints: Second Edition]({{< relref "2017-02-20-go-programming-blueprints-2nd-edition.markdown" >}})

I'm currently reading _AWS Lambda in Action_ and I intentionally postponed reading _Go Design Patterns_ because there was no *mobi* version available until recently, but finishing those in March is something that will happen.

For me the highlight of February was the change I planned to make to [templenv](https://github.com/MarioCarrion/templenv), also added more tests and increased the code coverage; all I need now is to update the CI and get some feedback.

### What am I planning for March 2017?

Obviously finish reading both books I didn't complete in February: *AWS Lambda in Action* and *Go Design Patterns*; after those are completed I will start focusing more on non-technical books, specifically I'm planning, to at least, read *The Extraordinary Leader* and if I still have some March left I will continue with *Ego Is the Enemy* and *The ONE Thing*.

Also I must think of pet project, maybe another UML-like project like [MonoUML](https://sourceforge.net/projects/monouml/)? I don't know.
