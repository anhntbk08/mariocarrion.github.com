<p>I have to admit it. I spent a great week in Utah. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=novell+campus+provo+utah&ie=UTF8&ll=40.210614,-111.655726&spn=0.004179,0.009656&t=h&z=17&iwloc=A">Novell campus</a> is huge and the girls are <strong>really beautiful</strong>. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo,_Utah">Provo</a>, Thursday and Friday in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_lake_city">Salt Lake City</a>, and Saturday in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab,_Utah">Moab</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</strong></p>
<p>MonoHotDraw Hacking: I've added a new module of the <a href="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/viewsvn/monouml/branches/monohotdraw/">old branch</a> in <a href="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/viewsvn/monouml/trunk/monohotdraw/">trunk</a>. The project solution structure is changed: new folders that suggest classes' goal and coding beautyfying. I didn't port the library to <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a>, however I learned a lot by testing and writing a simple proof-of-concept library using Moonligth, of course, isn't scalable or pretty IMO, but will be the base for porting from Cairo/Gtk to Moonlight. The proof-of-concept has been <a href="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/viewsvn/monouml/branches/monohotdraw-moon/">branched</a> in our repository as <em>monohotdraw-moon</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday and Friday.</strong></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to be present in <a href="http://2008.utosc.com/presentation/117/">Banshee</a> and <a href="http://2008.utosc.com/presentation/124/">a11y</a> talks in USTOC 2008. Walking through the <a href="http://www.slcc.edu/">Community   College</a> remembered by older days back in college, and made me wonder about getting a Master's Degree.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday.</strong></p>
<p>In the weekend we hiked and 4-wheeled, I took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/sets/72157607048153443/">several pictures</a>, the place is awesome (you can die easily, btw) I was very impressed with the view and the feeling of being quiet to, actually, hear the silence. </p>
