<p>After thinking for a while I've decided to move my blog to the <a href="http://www.monouml.org">monouml.org</a> domain. <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> looks nice and has feeds by category, I like that feature.</p>
<p>By the way, I may start working since November 7th, after next thursday I will know.</p>
<p>I need to get all my posts from my older <a href="http://marioc.blogspot.com">blogger account</a>, I'll try to do that migration this weekend.</p>
