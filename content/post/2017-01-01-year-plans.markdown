[In 2016]({{< relref "2016-12-31-year-in-review.markdown" >}}) I read 31 books, this 2017 I must go beyond that I won't say a number but I will exceed 31, I will focus more on personal growth kind-of of books.

In January I will finish reading **Ruby Performance Optimization**, **Docker Networking Cookbook** and **AWS Lambda in Action**, I'll start reading **Introduction to Graph Theory** but I honestly believe it will be difficult to complete, the font is tiny and the content is _huge_ and the truth is that I do not want to rush it.

At work? More _Gofication_, and I'll start thinking about the **Panic Citi** project, Spring training is coming soon and I really want to write something regarding the Mets.
