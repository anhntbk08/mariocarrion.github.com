<p>Yes... This end of year I spend my time sleeping and, again, I didn't go out. However I woke up early and went to get some magazines... as you may think, the city is empty, everyone sleeping and some others awake but drunks asking for more to drink :-P</p>
<p>Anyway I found the magazines, I bought some and now, I've finished reading them. What's next? Keep updating MonoCanvas, and.. starting a diet :-P</p>
