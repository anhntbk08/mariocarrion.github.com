<p>Today, the congress had finished, I really enjoyed this last day, hearing that too many companies are supporting Linux for their products, it make me proud of being a Linux active user, I enjoyed the two last conferences were the better, an engenieer from <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> talked about the new database Oracle 10g, it's something like a distributed database, it uses a cluster for doing that, it isn't a "new" techology but it's Oracle :).</p>
<p>Then the last conference, an evangelist from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> talked about the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a> technology, there were a lot of people who had heard about the technology but there were a few people who had programmed a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a> application, now today everyone want to develop using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/default.aspx">VS.net</a>. We might see a new migration from Window users to Linux.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today</span>: 'Get caught on the free .NET'</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">By the way.</span> Tomorrow is the my little sister's birthday, Happy Birthday Gaby!!
