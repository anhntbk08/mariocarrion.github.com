<p>Yes, got a job, starting a career, but... what about ... you know... NOTHING! <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2006/02/12/friday-saturday/">The other day</a> I was close to waste some money... but thank I don't own too much :-P</p>
<p>Not too lucky anymore. Many are gone, now I feel kind of idiot because let them leave. Too many chances, too many. Now. I'm fucked!</p>
<p>Breath.... and... smile.</p>
