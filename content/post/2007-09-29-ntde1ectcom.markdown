<p>The known <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorun">autorun.inf</a> trick</em> to edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry">MS Windows regedit</a> and copy the executable file into Windows root folder. Too bad didn't work for me, I had liked running an edited regedit... oh wait I don't have regedit.</p>
