<p>I still don't know why people doesn't realize the bad security on Microsoft Windows and still uses it.</p>
<p>I went to print <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/1459562363/">some stickers</a>, after using the USB Memory on the shared computer and going back to home I found a great present on my USB filesystem:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/1459717229/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1093/1459717229_990cc904dd_m.jpg" width="240" height="112" alt="autorun.inf" /></a></p>
<p>The known <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorun">autorun.inf</a> trick</em> to edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry">MS Windows regedit</a> and copy the executable file into Windows root folder. Too bad didn't work for me, I had liked running an edited regedit... oh wait I don't have regedit.</p>
