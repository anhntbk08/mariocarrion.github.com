<p>I've been playing with Feisty since two weeks ago, there aren't any big changes other than improved performance and better desktop integration, however today after power the PC on my Xorg wasn't unable to start, the well known <em>Screen not found</em> problem. The process is the same as used with Edgy, I even noticed that there's a <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-9746.html">newer update</a> (21th December) in the Nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>Now am using the most recent Ubuntu-packaged kernel image with Beryl on Feisty using the <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=49806">Flatlooks</a> Beryl theme.</p>
