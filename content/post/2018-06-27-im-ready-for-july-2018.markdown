It is **really** crazy that today, 14 years and 2 days ago, I started blogging. My [first post]({{< relref "2004-06-25-weblog.markdown" >}}) describes the naive idea of rewriting [_Blogger_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)).

The "funny" thing is that a month later I would be completing an [ActiveView](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html)-like library, written in PHP4 using the newly introduced support for classes, called [HTML2PHP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/html2php/). It was slow as hell, I think I overused the new class feature. I decided to go crazy and implement it in a few days because back in the day I was thinking that "**The Web**" was going to be the `lingua franca` of the technical world.

I was so right.

Anyways! To celebrate this awesome milestone I decided to travel back in time, migrate from **CVS** to **git** [the repo](https://sourceforge.net/p/html2php/html2php/ci/master/tree/) using [Docker](https://gitlab.com/mariocarrion/blog-examples/tree/master/2018/06/27) **obviously**!

**Oh by the way**

Today I started using HTTPS for my blog. I've been using `https` professionally for years already but setting yours on your own was an interesting experience, from buying the certificate, associate it to the domain, making changes here and there, to finally have it ready.

Long live the **padlock!**
