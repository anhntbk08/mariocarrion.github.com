Today I finished reading my 27th book of 2017, the title is [Making Big Data Work For Your Business](https://www.packtpub.com/business/making-big-data-work-your-business), and similar to previous Packt books this one was also part of the [Free Learning program](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning).

**Making Big Data Work For Your Business** is a long non technical book, that mentions some Big Data technologies here and there but nothing like Manning's [Big Data](https://www.manning.com/books/big-data). This book focuses more on what happens before the **actual** _Big Data Project_, the planning and justification of the project itself.

The main goal of this book is to explain *Big Data* to people in your organization, what could happen while and during the implementation of this project, the benefits and possible impacts after implementation, it also covers how to build a team for converting those plans into action as well as how to share those findings. Although I feel is aimed to Managers and Executives, I still believe a technical person could benefit from reading it.

Beware, this a long business-like book, it could be tedious at times, so take your time when reading it.
