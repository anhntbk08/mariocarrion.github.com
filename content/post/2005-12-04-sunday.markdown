<p>I remember when younger I didn't used to wake up too early but nowadays, since I began working, I'm doing that. I would like to rest more but I just can't, I really try, but this weekends I've been having weird dreams that waking me up too early... I don't really rest but at least I like weekends... I don't do anything... but at least is weekend.</p>
<p>I'm printing my final report for bringing it tomorrow to <a href="http://www.itver.edu.mx">my U</a> and is taking me all the afternoon (there is a lot of content)... and I have to print it twice... oh man.. but let's see the nice part, I won't have to do this anymore and I will finally free of school-related issues... until my graduation day.</p>
<p>I haven't done anything interesting recently in <a href="http://www.monouml.org">monouml</a> nor monocanvas.... I need to get focus!</p>
