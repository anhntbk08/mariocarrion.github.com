<p>Yes... I was wrong... It is a lot of code... but it isn't really <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2005/11/09/spaghetti-code/">spaghetti code</a>, looks nice, scaling is easy and is object oriented...</p>
<p>Bad programming language, good programming style.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm finishing monocanvas' implementation based in the third draft.</p>
