<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>I spent all the day at school and ... only TWO CLASSES!.... anyway, I did some work about MonoUML, I hope that we will release the first alpha version, sooner.</p>
<p>Both Rodolfo and I, had been working a lot with the GUI, lets look the <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/monouml_0_0_0_4.png',755,557)">new sample</a>, as you can see there's new graphical features which are based on non-graphical features, we've decided to finish the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Use Cases</span> first, that might be the release 0.01. There are some weird bugs (due to diacanvas#), I still don't know if ReX had done anything yet... I hope he fix something quick :)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today:</span> 'CASE Tools had been for long time the most useful tools for Software Enginneers, if you don't use CASE Tools you are not anybody.'</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">By the way.</span> 'Today she traveled for getting a good job, I hope she get it, good luck!'
