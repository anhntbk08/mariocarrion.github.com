<p>I've bought a <em>Lifeview FlyVideo 3000 FM</em> TV Card. Setting up was not difficult at all, you will only need to follow <a href="http://www.linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Generic_SAA7134_Card_Installation">this webpage</a> and <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_saa7134">this webpage</a>, basically</p>
<p>I added:</p>
<p><em>options saa7134 card=2 tuner=43</em></p>
<p>to <em>/etc/modprobe.d/saa7134</em></p></p>
<p>Using saa7134 kernel module and installing <a href="http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/">tvtime</a> did the trick.</p>

<p>And yes the Remote Control works.</p>
<p>By the way, yesterday while playing soccer I hurt two of my hand fingers and today both are hurting like hell, I can't close fist. It hurts so bad. Saddest thing is I can't type at all :(</p>
