<p>After reading the announcement I decided to upgrade to <a title="Wordpress content manager" href="http://wordpress.org/">WP 2.0</a>, works better, nicer 'write post' UI, <a title="Upgrading to WP2.0" href="http://mario.monouml.org/wp-admin/codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">upgrading</a> is quite easy. I also need to upgrade my older monkey-based skin but at least I like current red-based one.</p>
<p>Nothing have happend recently, working takes me all the day. Sometimes at work I spend time alone, I use that time for thinking, thinking in solutions for my current projects, thinking in people, thinking in myself, remembering things that I've done and long time ago I said won't do it... time changes everything.<br />
However my labor future looks nice, I'll start to use my favorite <a title="Penguin power" href="http://www.linux.org">OS</a>, migrating a QNX-based app to Linux, and using one of my favorite programming languages: <strong>C</strong>. Older but still usefull.</p>
<p>I'm planning a <a title="Drawing library" href="http://www.monouml.org/mediawiki/index.php/MonoCanvas">MonoCanvas</a> release on Febraury :-) I hope we can do it.</p>
