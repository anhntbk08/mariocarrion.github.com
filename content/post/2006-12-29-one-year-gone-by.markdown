<p>Today when eating I was talking with a coworker, at the end we agreed the fact that as older you are as faster time goes on and  things that in past years were so important are start becoming less important every day, hoping never get bored of doing that things that enjoy.</p>
<p>I'm dog-tired, really am, so exhausted, but now month is gone and so does the year. This weekend is for resting and FOSS-coding.</p>
