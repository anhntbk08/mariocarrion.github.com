I can't recall exactly when was the last time I took a break longer than a few days. Either way I know for sure one thing: San Francisco marks the start of our long vacation! Interestingly enough we had planned this trip since last year for one special reason!

That special reason was for attending a wedding, we could not miss it: two good friends were getting married! It was a nice event that brought back nice memories when we went there five (or six?) years ago. We were also able to catch up with some other friends that used to live here in New York but now live in California.

Good times.

After the wedding we spend two days in San Francisco, we did as much as we could, we visited different cool touristic places including revisiting the [Palace of Fine Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Fine_Arts) and visiting for the first time the [Cable Car Museum](http://www.cablecarmuseum.org/), [Coit Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower) and [Exploratorium](https://www.exploratorium.edu/)! We also rode the famous Cable Car (again!), we explored [Fisherman's Wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Wharf,_San_Francisco) at night and we took the [AT&T Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Park) tour! Sadly we weren't able to see the field, because apparently Ed Sheeran was having a concert that day, also the Giants were not in town so we weren't able to attend a real game, at least the tour guide showed us [some _exclusive_ areas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/albums/72157673043629578) in the park.

It was cold in San Francisco but we had fun!
