title: TODO? FIXME? HACKME? OTHERME?
url: /2006/11/27/todo-fixme-hackme-otherme.html
---

<p>Months ago found a bash-like script to grep <em>FIXME</em> strings from <em>find</em> command, written by <a href="http://www.mdk.org.pl/">Michael Dominic</a>, I've updated its code to allow other words such as TODO or HACKME. <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/files/fixme2html.sh">Grab it</a> and send me any comments if you want to. Of course needs love and more details, but works for me. To use it run</p>
<p><code lang="bash">./fixme2html.sh /fullpath/to/sources/ /fullpath/output.html</code></p>
<p>One thing removed from <a href="index.php/applications-todo/">TODO-list</a>.</p>
