<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>After almost all the day I've finished all the makefiles for allowing to build the MonoUML CVS version with just a simple "make" from the root path, then I started to code the new MonoUML's GUI version, I added some basic features such as: Open Project (that's all) we are starting, what did you expect?! =P.</p>
<p>The Diagram Interface (<a href="http://expertcoder.sf.net">by Rodolfo</a>) based on ExpertCoder is almost finished, and today, from the mail-list, I received a new email from some guy from somewhere, he may be from some place far away, maybe Europe, our project is becoming popular, some other projects are joining to ours. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/monouml_0_0_0_1.png',971,630)">sample</a> of the new GUI, as you can see, almost all elements are dettachables, and the TreeView was build through the XMI file, using the MonoUML.DI library.</p>
<p>By the way, Mario Fuentes, aka ReX, had joined again to our project, he will fix and will try to stabilize the Diacanvas# library, we really hope so =).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today: </span>'Join to our project, you will have a lot of fun. '</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">By the way.</span> I've enabled the Comments feature, due to Fabian asked about, I hope getting nice comments.. =)
