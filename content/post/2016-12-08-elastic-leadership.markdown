I was interested in [Elastic Leadership](https://www.manning.com/books/elastic-leadership) since I saw the MEAP a couple of months ago, I'm always trying to become a better leader and this book seemed like the obvious one to buy.

I bought **Elastic Leadership** beginnings of November and started reading right after I finished [Specification by Example]({{< relref "2016-11-30-specification-by-example.markdown" >}}), to my surprise it did not take me that long to finish. It was an easy read, a few days while commuting and done.

**Elastic Leadership** resonates with me, having working professionally for more than a decade already I can tell you I have experienced all three phases:

1. Survival phase: no time to learn
1. Learning phase: learning to solve your own problems
1. Self-organizing phase: facilitate, experiment

It's like every time I read a book about leadership, (just like when I read [Beyond Blame]({{< relref "2016-03-09-beyond-blame.markdown" >}})) I feel the author is reading my mind. **Elastic Leadership** is no exception, it certainly explains the frustration we feel as leaders as well as being part of a team.

In the end my takeaways from **Elastic Leadership** are:

* Always try to leave your comfort zone to get better, do one thing that scares you every day,
* Use _commitment language_ when expressing yourself and in a way invite your peers to use the same language,
* Talk to your teammates and collaborate to avoid being the bottleneck,
* Follow the [Team Leader Manifesto](http://5whys.com/manifesto)
