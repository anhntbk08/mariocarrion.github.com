[Docker Networking Cookbok](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/docker-networking-cookbook) is a book written by _Jon Langemak_ and published by Packt Publishing in December 2016. This book is part of the set of five books I bought during the 2016 holiday sale, the others I already finished reading are [Monitoring Docker]({{< relref "2017-01-11-monitoring-docker.markdown" >}}) and [Getting Started with Kubernetes]({{< relref "2017-01-23-getting-started-kubernetes.markdown" >}}), and only missing two other Go books.

Anyway, back to this Docker Networking book.

**Docker Networking Cookbook** is by far the most detailed and long Docker book I've ever read, I did not know what to expect when I first saw it but I'm really glad I got it, and it didn't disappoint. It obviously covers Docker networking, from your basic networking to your docker network configuration options and it goes to detail and describe concrete examples. It contains information regarding the already supported Docker network options as well as third party network solutions like [Weave Net](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave).

**Docker Networking Cookbook** is the first book I regret buying the digital version instead of the printed one, and I'm considering getting the printed version after reading it, I feel the real value of this book is having the pages right there in front of you, but there's also the problem of the constant evolution of Docker that could make this book obsolete in months. It's a dilemma.
