<p>After my return to my beautiful city I've been doing <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTHING</span> but when I was doing nothing I discovered some new stuff about the <a href="http://diacanvas.sourceforge.net/csharp.php">diacanvas#</a>, new it works "more", at least the NeedUpdate works, but still doesn't appear the DiaShapes. By the way I've registered the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/monouml/">MonoUML</a> project at SourceForge, the sf staff acepted the project really fast, now I'm waiting the uml# (which I'm also developing :P) Rodolfo Campero accepted to help me, he is developing the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expertcoder/">expertCoder</a> which will be the last MonoUML's layer (with uml#), I hope finish the uml# faster, I need to code a lot for MonoUML, if somebody wants to help us, just email us or visit our projects.<br />
I learned today: 'I miss her, but don't tell anyone, let's make that our secret.'
