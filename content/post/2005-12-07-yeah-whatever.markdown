<p>While going to home in the company's bus... I see the places that we leave behind... the cold air hits my face and I notice that I'm too tired... I begin to remember my weird dreams... many of them are really weird... there are like hollywood horror movies.</p>
<p>I bring my PDA for listening daft punk music... I almost fall sleep while traveling... at least a few time for resting and being nice...</p>
<p>I want to go to the movies... maybe this weekend.</p>
