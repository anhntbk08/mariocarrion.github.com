As a way to *keep the ball rolling* I will be blogging my monthly goals every first of the month. I will be describing what I plan to achieve and I evaluate how effective I was the previous month.

Obviously this is to keep myself motivated, engaged and more importantly I want to leave a digital trail, so next year I can measure myself.

Because **if don't measure it, you can't improve it**.

Obviously the goals must be concise and realistic, no need to exaggerate or set some ridiculous goals, there's nobody to impress here.

I believe that **5 hours a week** is fair enough, I know it may not sound like a lot of time, but it is, specially when you're a busy man.

**February 2016** officially starts this yearly iteration. In this month I will finish reading two of the three books I have about Go.

1. [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)
2. [Go in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action)

The other one is [Go Programming Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/go-programming-blueprints). I'm almost done with the first one, so it shouldn't be that difficult to complete the other one.

Obviously finishing those two books do not include my daily reading while commuting, this is reading at home at night.
