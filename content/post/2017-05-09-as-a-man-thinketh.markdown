[As a Man Thinketh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_Man_Thinketh). 

I find really crazy to read this book, a book written in 1903, just now; not because it's old but more because it took me this long to discover.

This book, or rather say _essay_, is a really quick read, no more than 2 hours to complete, and that I believe is what makes this book special, it is really concise and it has great content for people trying to personally become better human beings, it describes how you should how to handle yourself and how rationalize your thoughts. 

This is definitely one of those books you have to read once a month to keep yourself motivated and on track.
