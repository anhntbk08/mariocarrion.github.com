[Getting Started with Kubernetes](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/getting-started-kubernetes) is a book written by _Jonathan Baier_ and published by Packt Publishing in December 2015. This is my first [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) book ever, and coincidently I got this one as well for only $5 during the holiday sale, just like I did with [Monitoring Docker]({{< relref "2017-01-11-monitoring-docker.markdown" >}}).

I'm learning all I can about Kubernetes, as a matter of fact I'm also watching the [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud615) course from Udacity, and I'm also planning to eventually get both [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) and [Kubernetes: Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043874.do).

I liked this introduction a lot, and honestly it is hard for me to give a bad opinion about this book because I don't have any other books to compare to. The takeaways I get from this book is a lot of new projects:

* [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster), [fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/) and [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) for logging, monitoring and log visualization.
* [OCI, Open Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/), and [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) this amazes me a lot, I wasn't aware there were dedicated groups trying to come up with an standard.
* [Tectonic](https://tectonic.com/), for administration, and [StackDriver](http://www.stackdriver.com/) for monitoring.
* [Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com/),[Kismatic](https://apprenda.com/kismatic/) and [Deis](http://deis.io/), all three third party companies for running K8s in production.

Quick read and money well spent.
