Today I finished ready my 10th book of the year **[The Compound Effect](http://www.thecompoundeffect.com/)**.

Definitely not a technical book, that's for sure, but one I decided to buy and read because, believe or not, Amazon recommended it. Honestly I'm glad I bought it, because it does offer a different perspective on how to achieve specific goals.

It is a quick read, that brings really simple and easy to follow steps, highly recommended.
