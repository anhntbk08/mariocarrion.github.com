<p>Next weekend will attend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance">My Chemical Romance</a> concert on Mexico City, will leave Veracruz on Friday night to arrive Saturday Morning. My little sister likes so much this band, that's the reason to travel, both my two sisters and I will travel.</p>
<p>They play great songs and latest album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Parade">The Black Parade</a> is a good recomendation to hear.</p>
<p>I'm guessing will have a great weekend.</p>
