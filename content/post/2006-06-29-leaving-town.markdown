<p>I'm seeing that <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/MXMS0064.html">is raining</a>, don't enjoy raining (you know, you  can get wet :P) but like to travel and love resting when rains, sleeping is the best, am going to sleep in the bus. Here happends the same is raining and I thank about it, the heat days ago was killing me.</p>
<p>I will travel on Friday's midnight to vote in the Sunday Presidential Elections hoping everything goes fine after that exciting voting day.</p>
