2018 was greater than [2017]({{< relref "2018-01-04-looking-back-at-2017.markdown" >}}), professionally and personally I was able to achieve the things I wanted to and planned to do.

### Professionally

* 100% _Go-fication_ started!,
* I grew my Backend team!,
* I was promoted and given more responsibility!,
* Our team was able to deliver the first phase of our new proprietary platform, **and**
* We made sure our existing platform was able to handle all the traffic coming from the newly acquired [Time Inc properties](http://fortune.com/2017/11/27/meredith-is-buying-time-inc-for-1-8-billion/), which is more than 6 times than before!

### Personally

* Used all my paid days off before October 1st!! (**greatest 2018 achievement**),
* Watched out first NHL game (Go Islanders!),
* Attended [GothamGo]({{< relref "2018-04-27-gotham-go-2018.markdown" >}}) ([Photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/sets/72157666298769767)),
* Traveled to Santa Rosa and toured [AT&T Park](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/sets/72157673043629578) in San Francisco,
* Traveled to Denver to attend [GopherCon]({{< relref "2018-08-29-gophercon-day-3.markdown" >}}) ([Photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/sets/72157670885292497)) and toured [Coors Field](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/sets/72157703645952514),
* Traveled to Boston to see, with The 7 Line Army, the [Mets game at Fenway](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/sets/72157700727931442),
* Attended NYCC,
* Visited [Citi Field](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/albums/72157665412582287) more times I can remember!,
* Saw [Aladdin The Musical](https://www.aladdinthemusical.com/),
* Completed [20 books]({{< relref "2018-12-29-top-5-books-in-2018.markdown" >}}),
* Started two new open source projects [loteria](https://github.com/MarioCarrion/loteria) and [nit](https://github.com/MarioCarrion/nit),

### What are my plans in 2019?

**At least** this is want I want to accomplish in 2019:

* Continue what I started 4 years ago!,
* Complete `nit` by the end of February,
* Read more than 20 books,
* Attend GothamGo 2019,
* Attend Gophercon 2019, and
* Start a new open Source project.

As usual in 2019, I made a choice, committed to it and I trusted the process.
