[Last month]({{< relref "2017-08-01-august-goals.markdown" >}}) went by super fast, not to mention Summer is officially over and it's getting really chilly... anyways, what did I accomplish last month _August 2017_?

### Professionally

There's a new promising initiative in the works, _**the** globlal unification_, kind-of. My wild guess is that we will complete this project in like 2-3 years. Exciting times ahead of us to say the least.

### Personally

I'm struggling a bit to properly schedule all the things I want to do, it's the usual case of _I want to all of this, but in the end I don't do anything_. Sad, but true. I need to focus and plan daily.

The positive of August was finishing reading [The Power of Habit]({{< relref "2017-08-15-the-power-of-habit.markdown" >}}) and starting reading _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_, the latter is still in the works but I should complete it by the first week of September, great reading so far.

I was able to blog a bit about some other unrelated things, mostly work-related, like [left joining in Rails]({{< relref "2017-08-10-left-join-rails.markdown" >}}), the steps for [connecting to RDS and Redshift using SSL]({{< relref "2017-08-29-rds-redshift-ssl-tls.markdown" >}}) and to my surprise the [huge increase of traffic since last year]({{< relref "2017-08-18-one-year-later.markdown" >}}).

Although I did not finish the two books I planned last month I'm still on pace to reach the same number of books I read last year, to me it is really important to read **at least** the same number of books as 2016, obviously my goal in mind is always reading meaningful books, _no stat padding allowed_.

### What am I planning for September 2017?

Continue and complete _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_, focus more on my personal health and write more Go than before. Go. Go. Go.
