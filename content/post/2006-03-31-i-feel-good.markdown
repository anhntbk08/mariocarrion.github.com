<p>I like fridays, I think it's the best day ever, your weekend ends, you are free, you are able to enjoy some beers, I just love it!. However I'm planning, this weekend, to finish MonoCanvas migration, I don't really like being like this, I've haven't yet finished this API, must be finished sooner! MUST IT!!!</p>
<p>BTW. I need to buy a new mouse, set some some details for buying linux-like stickers and printing XMI Specification. I can't wait for tomorrow!!</p>
