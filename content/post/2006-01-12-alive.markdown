<p>I changed power supply and everything looks nice. Faster, better, <a target="_blank" title="GNOME!" href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>r :-) I'm also going to upgrade my RAM, more memory is always better. BTW I've got my <a title="Get your CDs!" target="_blank" href="http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu CDs</a>, gave all at work! While give them hear some nice quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have the serial key number? <em>You don't need, open source... free software?</em></li>
<li>Is it borrowed? <em>No, it's all for you</em></li>
<li>Is it a demo? <em>One CD one powerfull OS</em></li>
<li>What it is? <em>A very good Linux distribution</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We will start using <a title="Ubuntu Linux" target="_blank" href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a> at work! Excelent!</p>
