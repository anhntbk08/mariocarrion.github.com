<p>At the morning I viewed my yahoo's email, and I received an <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/cheat_credit_card.png',1028,725)">obvious cheat e-mail</a>, as you can see there's the old MS Explorer Bug which shows at the "url editbox" some predefined url which isn't the right one. But, remember I DO NOT run MS Explorer... nor Windows. Don't get caught with this cheater.</p>
<p>By the way, today started the <a href="http://www.itver.edu.mx/congresos/cisc2004/">4o Congreso Internacional de Ingenieria en Sistemas Computacionales</a>, due to that, I haven't gone to school,  I may go to school until monday.<br />
In the first conference, the engineer talked about the new educational process, the conference was good. The second a Doctor from <a href="http://www.digipen.edu">DIGIPEN</a> talked about the games and how they are written, they use DirectX and OpenGL for rendering... I didn't asked something but they may be using Windows (I hope not), by the way... at his conference his laptop hanged due to some weird and unusual Windows Media Bug X). I didn't like the third conference, the girl was reading something about e-libraries. The last one, the fourth, it was too good, a russian Dr, who spoke in spanish, talked about the Natural Language Processing, too good.</p>
<p>I saw (also today) the movie King Arthur, is good, it is like the Braveheart movie, it's good, you must see it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today:</span> 'There's nothing better than a Unix-based Operating System (AKA. *BSD, *Linux)'
