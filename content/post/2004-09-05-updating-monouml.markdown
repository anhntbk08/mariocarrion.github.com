<p>After been (this weekend) working on my Database project, I did<br />
<code><br />
$ cvs update -dP && make run<br />
</code><br />
for updating the MonoUML's code, the code is working, thanks to <a href="http://expertcoder.sf.net">Rodolfo</a> for his help, due to I'm too busy for coding, he is developing some new nice features and I'm trying to solve my school's problems. There is a <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/monouml_0_0_0_5.png',735,615)">new screenshot sample</a> for MonoUML. I'm thinking to travel for seeing her. I might travel in the next month: October 23th/24th for celebrating the first anniversary. :).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today:</span> 'I will travel to see her'</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">By the way:</span> 'I'm a new <a href="http://www.monohispano.org">monohispano</a>'s commiter, thanks to Alvaro del Castillo and Fabian Seoane for their help, I will update some tutorials sooner.. I hope so'
