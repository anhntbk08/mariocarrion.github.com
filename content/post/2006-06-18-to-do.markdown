<p>I finally compiled Antlr C# runtime with mono, however, there are some bugs in the nant build file, so you need to change the default MS Windows file separator to the default UNIX file separator, you know, replace the '\' with '/', then comment the automatic-AssemblyInfo.cs-file section to let nant run, after building you will have: <em>antlr.astframe.dll</em> and <em>antlr.runtime.dll</em>.</p>
<p>I'm also searching and learning about <a href="http://gtksourceview.sourceforge.net">GtkSourceview</a>'s language specifications to use it in our OCL editor, we need, of course, OCL syntax before beginning the editor and to register <a href="http://www.gnome.org/learn/admin-guide/latest/mimetypes-0.html">its MIME-type</a>, implementing both Reverse Engineering from sources and the OCL editor will be a nice experience.
