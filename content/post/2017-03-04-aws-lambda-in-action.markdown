[AWS Lambda in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/aws-lambda-in-action) is a book written by _[Danilo Poccia](https://danilop.net/)_ and published by Manning Publications in November 2016. Similar to other Manning books I own I got this one while it was in [early access](https://www.manning.com/meap-program), I got it because I'm super interested in this new _buzzword_ called _Serverless_.

_AWS Lambda in Action_ perfectly introduces this new Amazon service, almost all chapters include practical examples with code written in both JavaScript and Python. It explains how to deploy, test and design a service using AWS Lambda, how to interact with other AWS Services, like [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [Dynamo DB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as well as external services such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), as well as how to log and monitor your Lambda functions.

The meaty part in _AWS Lambda in Action_ is the last chapters where everything intersects and you are able to build a complete Lambda-based API, the only topic I feel needed a bit more of content is _Testing_; I know it is hard to have a dependency on a web-based service like Lambda and run your tests locally without an internet connection but I guess a few examples maybe using mocks or something provided by Amazon would have helped, obviously not the author's fault if the tools do not exist at this time.

_AWS Lambda in Action_ did not disappoint.
