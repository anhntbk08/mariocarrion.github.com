[Building the Web of Things](https://www.manning.com/books/building-the-web-of-things) is a book written by _Dominique D. Guinard_ and _Vlad M. Trifa_ and published by Manning Publications in June 2016. I got this one during a sale while it was still in [early access](https://www.manning.com/meap-program), I decided to wait a bit until the final version before starting reading.

**Building the Web of Things** is the first book completed [this month]({{< relref "2017-02-01-february-goals.markdown" >}}) and to tell the truth, although it is a really easy read, it took me way longer to finish than expected. I did not want to rush it because this is, practically, my introduction to [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things).

Being my first _IoT_ book everything was new to me, however I was able to recognize a few hardware brands and software but in the end this was new territory. So did I like it?

**I did**, I liked it a lot. I consider it a great introduction for people with zero experience, like me, to _Internet of Things_. Starting from the first chapter the authors introduce you to what is _Internet of Things_, they describe some real world examples and explain the current state of the art. I think te coolest thing about the book is the _hands-on_ approach, they include snippets of code ([that is downloadable](https://github.com/webofthings)) to explain how to connect, interact and build your own **Thing**.

What I believe is the selling point of **Building the Web of Things** is the full explanation of the [architecture proposed by Dominique Guinard](http://webofthings.org/2011/12/01/phd-web-of-things-app-archi/), it covers and explains all layers with code examples while introducing new proposed standards, software, protocols and cool stuff I never knew of before.

**Building the Web of Things** is definitely for anyone interestest in Internet of Things.
