<p>I'm finishing the porting from QNX to Linux, have been doing lot of testing and fixing several bugs, in other words have being busy. By the way, always know <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">Bugzilla</a> is good but it really rocks!</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, am starting to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-C/dp/0321126971/sr=8-1/qid=1156908408/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8233492-7025750?ie=UTF8">Design Patterns in C#</a> by Steven John Metsker, it's an interesting book, based on the book written by Gamma et al, focused in the .NET framework, contains UML diagrams, nice book really.</p>
<p>And yes I upgraded to Ubuntu Edgy and haven't had any problem yet, better default GTK+ theme, no more brown colors.</p>
