I thought [_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) will be similar to [The Power of Habit]({{< relref "2017-08-15-the-power-of-habit.markdown" >}}), I was wrong.

I did not plan to read _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ after _The Power of Habit_, but I'm glad I did because both books complement each other, and to me this one depends on the knowledge you gain from the latter.

There are lot of topics covered that definetly make you look at things from a different perspective:

* _Begin with the end in mind_
* _The Circle of Concern_
* _The work will come again, but childhood won't_
* [_Parapeto Principle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

The actual 7 Habits are really useful for properly managing your priorities, having a better personal and work relationships and constant self-improvement. It is a long book but every minute spent reading is well worth it.
