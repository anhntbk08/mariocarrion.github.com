[Boundaries: When To Say Yes, How to Say No](http://www.boundariesbooks.com/) is a book written by _Henry Cloud and John Townsend_ and published by _Zondervan_ in September 2008.

*Boundaries: When To Say Yes, How to Say No* is a theological book, kind of long, that explains how to define personal boundaries without sacrificing human relationships. In a way it gives you _the words_ to perfectly express yourself when doing so, and it really covers all possible cases: _family and work_. This means everything: your parents, spouse, children, bosses and friends. All bases are covered.

Despite the fact this book is really theological and mentions the bible a lot, I still believe it is a must read for everybody, you don't have to take the theological explanation if you don't want to *but* what is perfectly covered is the social aspect of what defining boundaries means. In the end what really matters is the social lessons you get from the book itself, the theological explanation is just a way to back up its reasoning.

Great book, highly recommended for anyone.
