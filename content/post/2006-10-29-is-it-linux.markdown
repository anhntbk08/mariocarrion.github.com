<p>While I was waiting my flight to Puerto Vallarta, you know, past month, because of <a href="festivaldesoftwarelibre.org">FSL2006</a>, a guy approached to me to ask about lend him my computer because needed to check something by reading his email, and I said "Yeah, why not?", hopping he was able to find the way in my Debian-based laptop, while he was grabbing the computer said "Is it Linux? Isn't it?" Of course I turn left to see <a href="djmaucom.blogspot.com/">Mauricio</a>'s face, because he was also waiting the flight, both were so impressed, that guy seemed to be a "normal one", you know, MSWindows-only user, however, we were so impressed because he knew the environment, and yes he is mexican too, based on his accent he was from <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterrey">Monterrey</a> or somewhere around. Is nice to find "normal people" who know Linux as well.</p>
