One of my *non official* resolutions this year was to read more, actually I have a [ridiculous long Amazon Wishlist](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1TXL98AB1S062) with all the books I want to read this year.

From that list, I've read:

1. [An Introduction to Programming in Go](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1478355824)
2. [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292397) See my [previous blog post]({{< relref "2015-02-12-book-1-soft-skills.markdown" >}}).
3. [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web Sites](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00503D1TY)
4. [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SVJA3M)
5. [Unraveling HTLM5, CSS3, and JavaScript](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OX1ZVTM)
6. [Unraveling Bootstrap 3.3](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OX1ZVTM)
7. [Knockout.js: Building Dynamic Client-Side Web Applications](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1491914319)

9. [Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails](http://smile.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Rails-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321659368/)

And I already own from that list the following books (and actually this is my **official** backlog):

1. [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts](http://smile.amazon.com/Things-Every-Programmer-Should-Know/dp/0596809484/)
2. [Practical Object-Orienteâ€‹d Design in Ruby](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0096BYG7C/)
3. [Real Time Analytics](http://smile.amazon.com/Real-Time-Analytics-Techniques-Visualize-Streaming/dp/1118837916/)
4. [Big Data](http://www.manning.com/marz/)
5. [Go Programing Blueprints](http://smile.amazon.com/Go-Programming-Blueprints-Mat-Ryer/dp/1783988029/r)
6. [Go in Practice](http://www.manning.com/butcher/)
7. [Go in Action](http://www.manning.com/ketelsen/)
8. [Go Web Programming](http://www.manning.com/chang/)

I like reading a lot and I like learning new stuff; and although I've been  working professionally for too long, I still like reading books about the topics I'm familiar with, there's always something cool to learn.

Another thing I want to do this year, besides reading a lot, is to learn something new, something *trendy*. My two options were [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [GoLang](https://golang.org/). After a lot of research I decided to go with GoLang, I still believe Javascript is a language you must learn, but research indicated that applications using NodeJS suffer from the callback hell and the maintenance becomes an issue, besides nothing can beat native compiled binaries... and honestly I miss C. So that's why I'm going all Golang this year!

I would probably revisit NodeJS next year, I still think is good a framework to learn, but until then I'm a Golang guy!!
