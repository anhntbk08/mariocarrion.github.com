_Independence month_ has started, that means half year is gone and 2017 is getting closer. Let's recapitulate my accomplishments so far, using the previous monthly updates as reference:

1. [February]({% post_url 2016-02-01-febraury-2016-goals %})
1. [March]({% post_url 2016-03-01-march-2016-goals %})
1. [April]({% post_url 2016-04-01-april-2016-goals %})
1. [May]({% post_url 2016-05-01-may-2016-goals %})
1. [June]({% post_url 2016-06-01-june-2016-goals %})

What I get from those previous posts is the following 3 things:

1. I've finished reading **18** books so far and I'm currently reading *Go in Action*. Based on that I will be able to finish reading 38 books this year, at least 30 that's for sure.
1. My personal free time estimates are _horrific_. I estimated I would be able to have 5 hours a week for working on _personal projects_, that was clearly a **Wrong** estimate. I really don't have an answer for this yet, but I'll keep trying.
1. The few open source projects I already created ([sentinel](https://github.com/mariocarrion/sentinel), [book-tracker](https://github.com/mariocarrion/book-tracker) and [dynamic docker composer](https://github.com/mariocarrion/dynamic-docker-composer)) have gained zero traction, obviously because I haven't had enough free time nor enough motivation, everything is in stand-by, sadly.

This is tough, because I do have some ideas, which to me sound interesting and appealing but the lack of motivation are killing any possible project before it even starts.

All I know for sure is that the first step in the journey is always the most difficult one, I just need to keep _pushing the envelope_.

So what is the plan for this July 2016? Simple:

1. Finish reading *Go in Action*.
1. Read **at least** two more books.
1. Have Dynamic Docker Composer **ready**.
