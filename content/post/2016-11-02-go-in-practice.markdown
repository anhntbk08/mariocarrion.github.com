[Yesterday I mentioned]({{< relref "2016-11-01-nov-2016.markdown" >}}) I was close to finish reading [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice) and today, I was two chapters away, on my way to work I finished one of the and tonight before heading home I tweeted about it

Similar to [Docker in Practice]({{< relref "2016-09-19-docker-in-practice.markdown" >}}) this book is all about tips, tricks and techniques related to the Go programming language. My favorites, in order of appearance, are:

* Graceful shutdown using [manners](https://github.com/braintree/manners)
* Several techniques for recovering from panics
* Embedding files in a binary
* Passing and handling errors over HTTP
* Chapter 10: Communication between cloud services
* Chapter 11: Reflection and code generation

Really happy with this book, it complements [Go In Action]({{< relref "2016-07-15-go-in-action.markdown" >}}) and [Go Web Programming]({{< relref "2016-10-06-go-web-programming.markdown" >}}).
