<p>I just don't like this season, too cold for me... and I don't live in a low-temperature place, I live close to beach... that might be the reason for hating cold places. I want to buy a digital camera, may do it this saturday I don't know... I would like going to take pictures from the places I go, like photography but haven't enough chance for taking pictures... I'll do from now on!</p>
<p>I need to buy some new books I haven't read any since long time ago, some clothes and some other things.</p>
<p>But I still don't like this season, too much kindness and too many <em>nice people</em> all around...  All kind of hypocrites... Oh dear christmas!</p>
