<p>After two weeks of hard work, I've finish the lastest release: 0.05, includes a lot of changes:<br />
- Indentation.<br />
- Only allowed elements for nesting.<br />
- Debugging.<br />
- Full documentation with examples.<br />
- Many other things.<br />
Anyway, I might update the API soon, there are still missing some other HTML elements. Also I'm part of the PHP# project, old project, exists since 2001, but for some weird reason the leader stop working on it, I will update the content and maybe on some months we will be using the php# compiler.<br />
I'm  thinking on building a new project, a CASE-kind project and it will be written on C#/GTK# using mono. :)
