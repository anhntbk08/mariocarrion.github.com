<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>After playing with MonoUML's code, I've added new features, some of them based on the feeback written by Rodolfo, look the <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/monouml_0_0_0_3.png',747,591)">new screenshot</a>, as you can see now the UML Element's name appears, and you can move it all over the canvas and it still keeps its relative position with the main widget, you are encourage to test it; the text's rendering is based on <a href="http://www.pango.org/">Pango</a> which is used by Diacanvas, cool isn't it?</p>
<p>There are some other features missing based on that widget, I'll add them soon (I hope so).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today:</span> 'I'm getting sad, because of her leaving, but I'll be better, I hope so :('
<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
