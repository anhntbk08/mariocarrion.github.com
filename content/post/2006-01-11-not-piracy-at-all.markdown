<p>I own an original MS Windows copy because of my laptop. I don't use it at all but someday (don't remember when) I installed and activated the serial number, now trying to using it through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> and... <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> refuses my serial number, reason? <em>You have already used this activation number...</em> now what? Do I need to buy another copy? <strong>FORGET IT!</strong></p>
<p>Deluded Mario, who though (again) that using original copies were the answer. I really tried, but allowing only few activations is a pain in the ass. I need to activate for using the OS... <strong>WTF!!</strong></p>
<p>I don't even use it everyday... I won't pay anything.</p>
