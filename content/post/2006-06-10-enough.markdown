<p>I've been inverting a lot of my time working in the current canvas forgeting the main project, <a href="http://www.monouml.org">MonoUML</a>, we need to upgrade the project, adding features while working in the canvas, I'm taking over the project again, doing some <a href="http://www.monouml.org">wiki</a> documentation and begining to improve  missing things, fixing bugs and everything else. MonoCanvas will be implementent while updating and improving MonoUML.</p>
<p>Going back to MonoUML!!</p>
<p>My current goals while helping <a href="http://ceronman.blogspot.com">Manuel</a> to finish MonoCanvas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve Reverse Engineering from CIL.</li>
<li>Reverse Engineering from Sources.</li>
<li>GtkSourceview OCL language.</li>
<li>Text editor WYSIWYG using the GtkSourceview language.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least two hours every day from Monday to Friday and all the day in weekend will do the trick.</p>
