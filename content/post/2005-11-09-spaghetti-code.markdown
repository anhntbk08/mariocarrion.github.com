<p>Finally I finished installing all the win-software needed for developing my project at work, I need to finish it at least in January 3th 2006. Today I began reading the older code... I'm too impressed about it!! A lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a> maybe written by <em>people in internship</em>, "learning" that system must not be longer than the next week, however I feel kind of weird while programming that thing, anyway I hope when finishing this project beginning some other linux-related project.</p>
<p>I hope waking up early tomorrow.</p>
