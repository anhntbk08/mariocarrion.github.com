Just like a mentioned in my [previous blog]({% post_url 2016-09-01-_sept-2016 %}) post, I finished reading [Docker in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/docker-in-action) today and what a phenomenal book! Actually I believe Manning Publications hand picks their authors because, so far, I always find them well written and with valuable information.

I'm a huge fan of Docker, I liked the concept from the first time I read about it and I've been educating myself and using it for about 1 year already. This is the second book I read about Docker, first one was [Docker: Up & Running](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZGRS4XM), and the truth is that *Docker in Action* is superior to the O'Reilly one.

The pace of the book is wonderful, the examples are clear and simple, not too complicated; if I had to complain about something it would be the last chapter, I felt it needed a little bit more, but still a good book overall. Kudos to the [Jeff Nickoloff](http://allingeek.com/).
