Just finished reading [Practical Object-Orienteâ€‹d Design in Ruby](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0096BYG7C/) by [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/). *POODR* is a phenomenal book for people really trying to write good, useful and long-lasting software.

I personally like Software Design books, I *fell in love* when I read the original Design Patterns by the [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) and I started to care a lot about design after reading [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/), obviously Software Design was one of the reasons I started working on [MonoUML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonoUML) long time ago, but that's a different story.

So what is *POODR* all about? Two words: Software Design, this book explains perfectly how to properly design, write, refactor and test software with one single goal: to write long lasting/cost-effective software.

I don't want sound pretentious but I was already aware of all the topics covered in this book. However, I still enjoyed the reading, the book is so well written and the examples are so clear that I really hope more Ruby developers read this book. Specially non Ruby developers, they should also consider reading the book, because the content not only applies to Ruby but in general to all programming languages, it is a great resource for learning about Software Design.

Recommended for everyone trying to step up and trying to become a real Software Engineer.
