<p>I went to Argentina to talk about the most recent project at work, and yes, we choosed Linux, now am porting all the QNX-based code to Linux, due to almost 80% is programmed using POSIX porting may be fast, some things such as TIPC, thread pooling and some endiannes issues are the "difficult ones" however am happy to working in this project.</p>
<p>By the way, I've recently bought a Playstation 2, yes I know, PS3 will be released sooner, but I just love some games that are only available in that console, and yes I've been playing a lot recently! I get relaxed while killing zombies ;)</p>
