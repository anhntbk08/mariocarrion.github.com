<p>I'm glad to announce my <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/files/monocanvas.html">MonoCanvas schedule</a>, we need to improve our development through <a href="http://www.monodevelop.org">MonoDevelop</a>, so am decided to implement MonoCanvas and release its first version this year, so be ready to test and report bugs.</p>
<p>By using <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Planner0">Planner</a> I've scheduled <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/files/monocanvas.planner">this implementation</a>, at least 3 dialy hours will be needed, first release attempts to appear finishing current year.</p>
