<p>Tonight I decided to clean my bedroom and throw away things, such as papers, notebooks, manuals and so on, and clothes that haven't used time ago and don't plan to use anymore. I'm kind of nostalgic when doing that, because usually spend time reading and leafing those notes to remember. I haven't yet noticed but this year will be my 24th birthday, am not that old but am closer.</p>
<p>Would like to visit some friends haven' seen since years ago.</p>
