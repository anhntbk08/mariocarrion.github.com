<p>Since two months ago I've been buying some magazines for staying in contact with most recent news, the bad thing about buying linux-related magazines (at least in spanish and here in MÃ©xico) is that all are too old, at least six months old, some english ones are recent but not too recent, one month, anyway I like reading about older news, I might miss one when it happened.</p>
<p>And yes, GNOME 2.13.92 is out and is very solid and pretty as <a href="http://images.google.com.mx/images?hl=es&hs=dbf&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&q=jennifer%20connelly&spell=1&sa=N&tab=wi">Jeniffer Connelly</a>! and yes <a href="http://banshee-project.org/Main_Page">banshee</a> <a href="http://gnomejournal.org/article/30/the-banshee-music-player-an-introduction">really rocks</a>!</p>
