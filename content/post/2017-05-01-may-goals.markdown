[April]({{< relref "2017-04-01-april-goals.markdown" >}}) is gone and I literally did not have enough time to _do anything_ personally. Here's last month's update and my plans for this month.

### Professionally

I've been really **really** busy, not bad news at all but it leaves me tired and with no energy to spend after coming home. I end up mentally exhausted and practically ready for bed. At least we are making significant and legit progress this time. Professionally that keeps my heart _warm_.

### Personally

I finished reading two of the planned books in April:

* [Ego Is The Enemy]({{< relref "2017-04-06-ego-is-the-enemy.markdown" >}})
* [The ONE Thing]({{< relref "2017-04-16-the-one-thing.markdown" >}})

I will complete reading the other one I planed, _Neo4j in Action_, in a few days from now.

### What am I planning for May 2017?

I want to focus more on my soft skills with a bit of technical skills, so May 2017 will be all about completing the following books:

* As a Man Thinketh
* Web Performance in Action
* Boundaries: When To Say Yes, How to Say No
* Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration
