<p>I'm kind of happy with my recent project, I haven't yet finished the older one but I need to keep going, I'm wrapping a Natural-written library using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_plus_plus">C++</a> for using it within an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>'s trigger. With this newest development I've faced some issues, many related to the full platform dependency.</p>
<p>When I begin working... well you know, I'm still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie">rookie</a> (in that job), and some of my partners were talking about <em>the Broker</em>  and <em>the PIP</em> (still don't know why they call PIP and Broker... to the library), first when I hear <em>Broker</em> I thought about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker">the pattern</a>... and is something like that, however when you hear <em>library</em> you imagine some well-constructed component for code reusing... and.. the most important thing <em>standard-based</em>, I was <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2005/12/10/deluded/">deluded</a> (again) by thinking that there they care about exporting the functions in an ANSI-way, using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>-based products brings you to use propietary technology (such as COM, DCOM, etc), they expose the libraries' methods like an Ole object, I'm not at good at MS tecnologies, but I like to learn and they have a lot of documentation and I have to do it anyway, I had two scenarios: modifying a Delphi-based application or writing this new project for running it all within the Database's process, of course I choosed second choice and due to we are using Oracle Database and Oracle support calling <strong>standard libraries</strong> for remote procedures and decided to wrap it for using.</p>
<p>C++ has been one of my favorites programming languages since I learnt programming, I really enjoy programming with C++, I'm happy with this new project, some challenges to defeat.</p>
<p>Pure distributed queries and database-based solution. Pure love.</p>
