<p>After restoring and downgrading to 1.1 everything worked again, I decided to try it again and upgrade to 1.2, and format the iPod's VFAT partition and recreating its "fylesystem" now iPod is working as usual, what happened last time? Don't know, but now seems to work.</p>
<p>BTW, Banshee's lastest update supports Podcasts, nice.</p>
