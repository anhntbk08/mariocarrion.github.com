<p>We are leaving friday or saturday, I still don't know the right day, and we have finished a lot of applications and tests, I've been working 12hours, at least, every day, am getting tired but somebody has to do it.</p>
<p>I would love sleeping right or seeing tv, hanging around or anything else. I will, of course!, do it when arriving.</p>
