Similar to [April]({{< relref "2017-04-01-april-goals.markdown" >}}), [May]({{< relref "2017-05-01-may-goals.markdown" >}}) was a practically a blink of an eye.

### Professionally

There's a new massive project going on, my team and I are building a lot of new things. I'm really satisfied with the progress we are making and more importantly **I'm pleased** with the way I designed the original system architecture 3 and a half years ago. I know there are lot of things that can be improved but the system has aged well.

### Personally

I finished reading 3 books, one of them a leftover from June:

* [Neo4j in Action]({{< relref "2017-05-03-neo4j-in-action.markdown" >}})
* [As a Man Thinketh]({{< relref "2017-05-09-as-a-man-thinketh.markdown" >}})
* [Web Performance in Action]({{< relref "2017-05-26-web-performance-in-action.markdown" >}})

Sadly _Web Performance in Action_ took significantly longer than estimated and that did not allow me to complete two of the planned books from last month:

* _Boundaries: When To Say Yes, How to Say No_ currently in progress, and
* _Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through Collaboration_ not yet started

I will complete both of them and add a third one [Streaming Data](https://www.manning.com/books/streaming-data), that should be enough for this month.

### What am I planning for June 2017?

**I will complete what I'm planning** also I already some posts drafted covering some things I want to write about. I feel like this month free time will be easy to find.
