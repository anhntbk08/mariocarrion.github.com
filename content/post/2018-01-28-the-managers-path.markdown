Being a Technical Manager is tougher than being a Manager because it includes dealing _with technical people_ and I know for sure we could be the most biased individuals out there, for better or worse.

I'm not complaining but I know, as being a technical person, we are passionate about what we do and how we do it, so I'm not surprised that it takes an extra effort to handle certain situations when managing a group of technical individuals.

In the past I read similar books to [**The Manager's Path**](https://smile.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/) for: managing people ([Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RTYMOQS)), managing projects ([Elastic Leadership](https://www.manning.com/books/elastic-leadership)) and also how to deal with not so pleasant situations ([Beyond Blame](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B016CJ5HUA) and [Debugging Teams]({{< relref "2017-06-26-debugging-teams.markdown" >}})).

**The Manager's Path** differentiates all the previous ones because it is written as the _evolution_ in professional growth from the author's perspective, it indirectly explains how the author's position transitioned into a management role: from being an Engineer, to Tech Leader, next to Director and finally CTO. More importantly it is written for technical individuals who wish to transition to a Technical Leadership position at some point in their career and who, maybe, never had proper management training.

**The Manager's Path** is a not-so long book written by [Camille Fournier](http://www.camilletalk.com/) that was published by O'Reilly in 2017. I found it fills the gaps left by all previous books I've read in the past, specially because it dedicates chapters for: Performance Reviews, Dealing with Dysfunctional Teams and Creating Culture, topics that although really useful are rarely covered; I personally found those specific chapters extremely useful, not to mention it is written from a _start up_ perspective as well so it could be useful for professionals starting their career.

**The Manager's Paths** is an enjoyable reading that will definetly help you to become the best Technical Leader you want to be.
