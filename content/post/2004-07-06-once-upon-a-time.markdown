<p>The time has passed since the last release, nowadays I'm thinking about coding a new CASE tool based on MONO and GTK#, something to design through UML, I'm also finishing the 0.06 release of the HTML2PHP API, adding some new features, crushing some bugs and rewriting the code as 'clean' as possible. I'm adding some cool features such adding improvents, efficiency and more examples. Writing a how-to is hard but not impossible, I hope finishing this sooner.
