  content: "heyas all.\r\nmy 40 gig drive is going to good use now. I have installed
    UBUNTU and have ordered KUBUNTU.\r\nI dont know how to install the driver for
    my ati radeon 9600xt.\r\nActually i dont know if i am meant to be downloading
    and installing XFREE86 or the XORG version of the driver. I am downloading them
    both but i dont know how to do anything in Linux really.\r\nI dont know where
    I am meant to set up my modem or set up a net account. (no INETWIZ.EXE)\r\nSo
    yeah, can someone help me out with getting my ATI driver installed?\r\nand does
    anyone know of a good long PDF file i can read and wrap my brain around.\r\nI'm
    still a Windows user, but I want to use Linux as much as possible.\r\nThanks.

<p>I've recently updated my Ubuntu desktop, after downloading at least 500MB I'm running it, and yes, works pretty nice.</p>
