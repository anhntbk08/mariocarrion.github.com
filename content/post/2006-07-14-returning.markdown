On the morning I went to get some souvenirs to my family, got some nice things, now am writing this from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago%2C_Chile">Santiago, Chile</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Merino_Ben%C3%ADtez_International_Airport">airport</a>.</p>
<p>Both my partner and I will arrive saturday morning to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, the travel isn't yet begin and am feeling too tired... maybe because of all the hand luggage am carrying however am happy because of my returning to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a>.</p>
