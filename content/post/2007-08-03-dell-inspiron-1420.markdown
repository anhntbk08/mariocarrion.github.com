<p>Let me say that <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/inspnnb_1420?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs">this laptop</a> is a beauty, its color availability let's you choose the one for you, and that's not all, because you are selecting a highly configurable computer, and of course at lower price you are on a great deal. Since my older <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2005/03/30/finalmente-2/">Inspiron 1150</a> I fall in love with Dell, yeah, we all know that takes, at least 2 weeks, that your order arrives at home (or somewhere else), but who cares, because at the end you will enjoy a great laptop.</p>
<p>There are known histories about running Ubuntu on Inspiron 1420 and mine is another. First I use <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/">Gusty Alternate CD</a> to install it, then by using Integrated NIC started downloading updates and upgrade to latest Gusty version. The following were the issue I faced.</p>
<ol>
<li>No X Windowing System. Do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and select <em>intel</em> as your X module.</li>
<li>No sound, followed the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto">Sound Howto</a> and after adding <em>options snd-hda-intel model=3stack</em> to <em>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base</em> did the trick. I didn't install anything from sources.</li>
<li>DVD/CD Rom didn't worked after installing,  Add <em>ide-generic</em> module to <em>/etc/modules</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>After doing all those tricks, Compiz Fusion works "out of the box". No more Vista.</p>

<p>Missing things to test: Card reader, FireWire and Bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>Update Sat 4</strong>. Card reader works, also out of the box, at least with SD cards. Bluetooth seems to be detected by the Nokia 770, FireWire is missing I don't have anything with FireWire</p>
<p><strong>Update Mon 6</strong>. <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/129477">Touchpad bug</a> is now fixed.</p>
