<p>I left Veracruz on Saturday Dawn, arrived at 7:30, ate breakfast and then to the event. A lot of interesting stuff. I saw great matches and there were a lot of things related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre">lucha libre</a>: cards, masks, videos and the list goes on and on. I ate one of the "Tortas Gigantes", and yes, those are really giant, and the great of the day was the dinner: Tacos, yeah! "<em>Mexico City Tacos!!</em>"</p>
<p>Next day we spent some time at the event, then we went to Arena Coliseo, the people in the arena was so excited about been there, people screaming and having fun. Great day. Great weekend. I must return.</p>
