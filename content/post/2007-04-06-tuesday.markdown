<p>Next Tuesday we'll, finally, integrate all our written modules for the plant, we are happy for finishing it. I'll try to implement a SendReply-like IPC this weekend due to actually need it, may include <a href="http://tipc.sourceforge.net">tipc</a> for network IPC in the future. By the way, this month will be 24 years older... time goes so fast.</p>
