  content: "Nokia 770 is a nice gadget, but it's not a phone! I really miss that.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I am going to buy is a Nokia N95. It is a GPS and can make photos. The downside
    is that includes Symbian, instead of the one from Nokia770."

  content: Yeah I'm aware of that, however Nokia have released a new accessory to
    attach it to 770 for using GPS (<a href="http://direct.nokia.com/Product.aspx?model=770-NavKit"
    rel="nofollow">the Nokia Navigation kit</a>). only sold in Europe so you might
    get it, and there some rumors of a new 770-based device that includes GPS.

<p>Since months ago I've been updating the older CLR Reverse Engineering implementation, the problems with current one are related to Generics, I still need to get deeper into the values Cecil allows to read from the assembly, hoping a sooner release.</p>
<p>I would love to get the Nokia 770, even found a <a href="http://www.nokiastore.com.mx">store here</a>!!</p>
