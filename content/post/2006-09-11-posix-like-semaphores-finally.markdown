<p>After trying and trying all day I've finally implemented a POSIX-like semaphore and my Win32-based ring buffer using this new classes, works nice, now I'm replacing the Windows Message Queue IPC to Win32 Ring Buffers, am having problems while doing this, will face them tomorrow morning, need to finish this as sooner as possible due to I have start migrating the most difficult (I guess) QNX application to Linux, may take two or three weeks so a need all the free time to spend it with this migration.</p>
<p>And yes... I haven't yet "asked for permission" to travel <a href="http://festivaldesoftwarelibre.org/fsl2006/">to Puerto Vallarta</a>, I really want to go, past year went and spent great week, I'll do the same again this year. :)</p>
