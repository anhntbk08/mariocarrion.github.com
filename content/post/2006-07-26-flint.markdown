<p>If you are out of Zippo flints and also own an empty BIC lighter you migth get BIC's flint to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EZE56UWUHSEP287K7Q/">use it in your Zippo</a>.</p>
<p>Works better when you are very desperated. I encourage people to only use Zippo-like materials, such as flints, wicks and fuel, using BIC flint is a quick hack and should be used in a emergency case not always.</p>
<p>By the way, am still missing some wicks, may buy them this weekend.</p>
