<p>I'm facing an issue related to inconsistences in the source code that am porting, for example, variable-naming: </p>
<p><code lang="C">struct sample {<br />
    int variableName;<br />
    int otra_variable;<br />
};</code></p>
<p>Did you notice the problems? First, using <em>camelCase</em> to declare the variable, then using <em>underscore</em> to separate words in variable, and also mixing both Spanish and English. I just don't like it. I'm updating the code while testing its performance. A C-based refactoring tool would be nice, </p>
<p>So I need, to find either C-based refactoring tool or write mine and then need to spell comments, by either finding an application or, also, writing mine.</p>
<p>So, now, I need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refactoring tool, to refactor C sources.</li>
<li>Comments speller tool, to spell source code comments.</li>
<li>Mediawiki 2 Docbook 2 MonoDoc, to allow browsing current manuals and tutorial in MonoDoc.</li>
<li>MonoCanvas, yes! I haven't yet finished this! Need it NOW!</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of free software to write.</p>
