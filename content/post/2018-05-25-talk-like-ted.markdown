**Talk like TED** provides 9 secrets, or tips, TED speakers have used over the years to properly deliver their message while keeping the audience engaged. Those 9 tips come from Gallo dissecting hundreds of TED talks, interviewing the presenters behind those successful talks and understanding the ideas behind their talks.

**Talk like TED** is broken down by _secret_, this means each section is dedicated to describe a single tip, it provides an explanation behind the secret and it mentions at least one existing TED talk that exemplifies it, in a few cases the same TED talk is used to describe multiple secrets in different sections.

The _secrets_ are:

1. Unleash the master within
2. Master the art of storytelling
3. Have a conversation
4. Teach me something new
5. Deliver jaw-dropping moments 
6. Lighten up
7. Stick to the 18-minute rule
8. Paint a mental picture with multisensory experiences 
9. Stay in your lane

**Talk like TED** provides some valuable tips for any speaker, it doesn't matter if you're planning to speak publicly to thousands or just a few, having those tips in mind when creating and presenting should make your presentation stand out, make it memorable and more importantly it will get your point across.

**Talk like TED** was a nice reading and the mentioned talks are recommended to watch if you haven't seen them yet.

**Talk like TED** is worth the time investment.
