<p>I really love <strong>Software Engineering</strong> and <strong>Oriented Object Programming</strong> ;-) </p>
<p>It looks <em>kinda freakin'</em> but when you set a good design and you only need to subclass and override some methods... and this saves your day and gives you more hours for sleeping... you just realize that thinking in software architecture terms really rocks!</p>
<p>Developing isn't <em>to program</em> is <em>to create art</em>, thinking before it happens.</p>
