Following the Docker theme of the month, I finished reading this one today. I got [Orchestrating Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/orchestrating-docker) for free as part of the [Free Forever Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) initiative by Packtpub, basically you could get a free book every day, you just have to claim it.

Having read the Docker Manning books before this one really raised the bar for me, this book does includes some interesting things to consider like introducing [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/docker_guide.html) and the explicit concept of [ambassador containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/ambassador_pattern_linking/) but that's pretty much it.

The good thing is that I didn't have to spend too much time reading it, it's a quick read.
