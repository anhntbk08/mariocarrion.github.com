<p>I'm planning to get a new camera (will be my birthday present!) my <a href="http://www.google.com.mx/search?q=Kodak+CD33">current camera</a> is not the right one, at least not for me, I'm sure had missing a lot of great moments due to its lowest functions, <a href="http://djmaucom.blogspot.com/">Jorge Mauricio</a> once recommend about Cannon and Nikon cameras, so I may get one of those, we'll see it very soon.</p>
