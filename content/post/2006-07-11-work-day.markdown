<p>We spent all the day in the plant, on the night went to dinner to a place called Rodizio near to Puerto Madero, pretty tasty meat and nice wine, ate like never, people said that Argentinian Meat is the beat, I agree, both "two legs" and "four legs" meat are so great :P. I haven't taken any argentinian girls photos, will do it tomorrow... or tonight, who knows.</p>
