<p>I like reading, surfing the web and looking some nice news about <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, recently something took me over, <a href="http://www.slackware.org">Slackware</a>, here, at school, all the linux users use <a href="http://www.slackware.org">Slackware</a>, reasons? I don't know, I haven't tryed it yet, I like <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, anyway I decided downloading all the Slackware's iso files for later installing; in the Slack's ftp I found some other distributions such as <a href="http://www.knoppix.org">Knopppix</a> (the lastest release: 3.6) which impressed me time ago because its powerful detection process. I also found this <a href="http://www.insyte.uni.cc/">nice Slackware website</a>.</p>
<p>Then, after downloading the live-cd (Knoppix) and the four isos (Slackware) I keep reading and I found a new Debian-based distribution which ships with the new <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> release, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.8/">2.8</a>, I don't like compiling from sources because of my machine's CPU, it's too slow, I would have to wait at least two days to get a nice <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> Desktop; the new distribution is called <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a>, it is based on Debian but it doesn't supports the Debian's packages (Knoppix does), it doesn't have <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">mono</a>, and obviously you can't apt-get it from SID because Ubuntu's/Debian's dpkg doesn't resolve those complicated dependencies... anyway the Ubuntu will include the mono binaries in the next release.</p>
<p>I haven't installed any of them, yet, I'm still too busy at school, doing some homework and studying for tests. I haven't worked with <a href="http://monouml.sf.net">MonoUML</a>, I'm sad because of that, but <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/monouml/">I added it</a> to <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">FreshMeat</a> :)</p>
