<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>Due to all the work done by Mario Fuentes with the <a href="http://diacanvas.sf.net/">diacanvas#</a>'s wrapping now we can see the shapes, look the sample, <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/diacanvas.png',466,368)">a clock running</a>. But still hangs randomly, I've been looking and I guess it hangs because of the *Update* methods, I need to do more tests, maybe later it is 04:24AM and I haven't slept, I'm too tired.<br />
Today I've suscribed to <a href="http://www.webcindario.com/">webcindario</a> now I have <a href="http://marioc.webcindario.com/">my own free webpage</a> for hosting my screenshots (I can't link them directly... :__(, does anyone wants to host me?) plus some other stuff. I'm happy because *maybe* today I'll get a new computer, 5 years had passed since my last *new* computer, today I'm using an old P3 350MHZ computer, still works but when I need to compile a large sw I wait too much time; I need to rest, but I'm afraid to sleep and don't hear the guy who will bring it.</p>
<p>I learned today: 'Maybe in two years diacanvas# will be stable.'</p>
<p>By the way: 'I've solved the "GNOME WARNING" issues. I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, I need some beers... I'm going to rest....'
