<p>Yesterday at night it rained like hell... a lot of rain... I just can't believe it, anyway, the summer is always like this.</p>

Martin send an email telling me about the lastest diacanvas#, now the API works, I'm trying to choose between the diancanvas#/gtk# and pydiancavas2/pygtk2... both are so good impletations. Python is fast, good and stabler than mono, and mono is the lastest technology, cooler and java-like, :S, a really difficult choice.</p>

I learnead yesterday: 'If it's raining... you must close all the windows'</p>
