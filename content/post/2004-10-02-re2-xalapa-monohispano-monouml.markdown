<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">A deadly virus has been unleashed on the population of Raccoon City.</span></p>
<p align="justify">For those all Resident Evil fans, you must go to the movies, I went yesterday for seeing <a href="http://www.re2.com/">Resident Evil 2</a>, I liked RE1, but I enjoyed more this one, really nice movie, nice plot, nice special effects, nice actors (I like the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/jillre2.jpg" target="_blank">Jill character</a> played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347149/">Sienna Guillory</a>, really pretty woman, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/alicere2.jpg" target="_blank">Milla Jovovich</a> is also pretty), if you are a truly RE fan I encourage to see the movie, you won't become disillusioned. I'm not film critic, but you must see it.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Xalapa</span></p>
<p align="justify">Today I went to a <a href="http://www.xalalinux.org/">LUG meeting at Xalapa City</a>, (here in Veracruz, here in Mexico), nice people, nice camaraderie; <a href="http://djmaucom.blogspot.com/">Mauricio</a> invited me. We saw the <a href="http://www.uoc.edu/dt/esp/deicaza0904.html">De Icaza's conference at OUC</a>, <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/activity-log.php">Miguel</a> talked about <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">mono</a> (as usual) and the <a href="http://go-mono.com/archive/1.1.1/">new mono features</a>. I talked (few words) about <a href="http://www.monohispano.org/">Mono Hispano</a> and <a href="http://monouml.sourceforge.net/">MonoUML</a> encouraging people to get involved in free software projects. Something that caught me the eye was that the LUG is heterogeneous, too much to learn. I enjoyed meeting those people.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mono Hispano</span></p>
<p align="justify">Both <a href="http://linux.mty.itesm.mx/~oramirez/">Orlando Ramirez</a> and I started to translate a <a href="http://genamics.com/developer/csharp_comparative.htm">new document</a>, the document is  great, objective criticism, I'll commit my advances later.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">MonoUML</span></p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://monouml.sf.net">MonoUML</a> is back! I'm adding some features to the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/uml_sharp_0_0_0_0.png" target="_blank">newest sample</a> made by <a href="http://primate.gnome.cl/~mario/">Mario Fuentes</a> (<a href="http://www.gnome.cl/">GNOME.cl</a> hacker, I can't deny it), as you can see now there are handlers for resizing the image, but there's a weird bug. Hold on, I hope fixing it tonight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I learned today</span>: 'Nice weekend, too many emotions! :) 21 days and counting.'</p>
