The first goal, [of three]({% post_url 2016-07-01-july-goals %}), has been accomplished. I finished reading [Go In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action), my first _in Action_ book from Manning, and **yes** this book does not waste any time to introduce and get you involved in Go, it gives you an idea of what you can do with the language and it covers important topics like channels and concurrency patterns.

*Go in Action* is concise, not a book I would recommend to _new_ gophers, but more for people who already read [An introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) because it could be hard to follow, specially the first and the last chapters, so you need to have some basics about the syntax and, of course, programming in general.

As a matter of fact, I believe this book really did it for me, because I already started working on [dynamic docker composer](https://github.com/MarioCarrion/dynamic-docker-composer) on a daily basis, a couple of hours here and there, so the third goal of the month is slowly started to become a reality.

What I'm planning to do next is to continue with the Go theme, and finish reading [Go Web Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/go-web-programming), I already finished reading the first chapter today, while commuting, so good progress so far.
