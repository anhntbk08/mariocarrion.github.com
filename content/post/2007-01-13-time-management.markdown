<p><em>I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in my body. Then I remembered who was telling me this.  - Emo Philips</em></p>
<p>I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007833/002-9883943-4929631">Time Management for System Administrators</a>, and I have to say that's a great book, filled with a lot of suggestions, if you want to <em>stop working late to start working smart</em> you must get it!</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7278397109952382318">45min video</a> with Tom Limoncelli, the author, about his book.</p>
