<p>We arrived yesterday, I forgot to bring any electric socket switcher because here is different, didn't know it, though was the same to all latinoamerica, anyway now I've gotten one.</p>
<p>Then left hotel to begin walking around it until find something to see, some sculptures, some people, by the way yesterday was the Argentinian Indepence Day, happends the same you can like in Mexico see a lot of Argentina flags all over the city, quite nice.</p>
<p>We are leaving the country until friday and we have a lot to see I'm hoping <a href="http://rodolfocampero.blogspot.com">Rodolfo</a> is able to party with us thursday night to know a little of Buenos Aires' night living.</p>
