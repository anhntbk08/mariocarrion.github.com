<p>I'm currently rewriting MonoCanvas (Yes! One more time!!), but now using Gtk#, Gtk.DotNet, Gdk#, Pango# and GDI+, however that's not the main discussion here. With this newer development I began writing some <a href="http://www.nunit.org">NUnit</a> <a href="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/monouml/trunk/monocanvas/gtksharp-based/MonoCanvasTests/">tests</a>, that obviously assures compatibillity between revisions.</p>
<p>However with my most recent project I will code with ANSI C and C#, and I, obviously, will do Unitary Tests, so I need to get an application for doing that in C and I did it, is called <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net/">Check</a> (<em>apt-get install check</em>). So there I am, ready for coding!</p>
