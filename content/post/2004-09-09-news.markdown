<p>New features had been added to MonoUML:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments allowed for elements and nested comments for comments.</li>
<li>Command line arguments, for opening projects from shell.</li>
<li>The toolbar icons now work.</li>
<li>A lot of EC bug had been fixed.</li>
<li>The GUI had changed, now uses Paned widgets, like in the early beginning.</li>
<li>Support for Use Cases almost complete (ALMOST).</li>
<li>Some other... :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Look the <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/monouml_0_0_0_6.png',679,547)">newest</a> screenshot, you are encourage to do <span style="font-style:italic;">cvs update -dp</span> to our CVS.</p>
<p>All the features were done by the current MonoUML team (Mario Fuentes, Rodolfo Campero and Mario CarriÃ³n), the other part of the team had not done anything yet, I hope to get some help from some other people sooner.</p>
