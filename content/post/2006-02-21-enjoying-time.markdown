<p>I spend all the day programming, you know, because of my job, but when I come home can't stay away of keyboard, really love developing, it's kind of an addiction or something.</p>
<p>Nowadays have been quite exciting, many bugs have been fixed, many code improved. I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>By the way, MonoCanvas' first release is closer don't stop reporting bugs! ;-)</p>
