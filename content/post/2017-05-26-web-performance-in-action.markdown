[Web Performance in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/web-performance-in-action) is a book written by _Jeremy L. Wagner_ and published by Manning Publications in December 2016.

*Web Performance in Action* is one of the most useful books I've read this year, its relevance to my job and the fact that it is a _recent one_ make it a **really** valuable and relevant reading. I learned a bunch of new tricks that already made the difference when building new Web Services. Although I specialize in Backend and Web APIs, the content described in the book is still very useful.

*Web Performance in Action* is definitely a must for all people working on Web Services, this includes the Sysadmins in charge of the Web Servers and obviously the programmers behind the code using those Web Servers. I may read like a broken record but it is indeed a book that has to be read by everybody building software that uses Web Browsers for interacting with users.

My personal takeaways:

* [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes)
* img's [srcset](https://webkit.org/demos/srcset/)
* Flash of Invisible Text and [Flash of Unstyled Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)
* Compression tips for Javascript, Images and regular HTML files.
* Native alternatives to jQuery functions
* Making your Web Service work offline.
* HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 best practices and how to deliver HTTP/2 while having HTTP/1 compatibility.
