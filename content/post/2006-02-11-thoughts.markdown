<p>I need to get it new. Then <em>everything</em> will stop and will feel better. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm hoping, tomorrow, to wake up early for going to print the final <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/uml.htm">UML 2</a> specification (adopted on august 4th 2005) to use it for two main porpuses: <a href="http://www.omg.org/uml-certification/index.htm">showing what I know</a> (and to get a greater salary ;-)) and because really need it for <a href="http://www.monouml.org">MonoUML</a>, this due to MonoCanvas is getting closer to its first release and writting UmlCanvas# is my new goal.</p>
