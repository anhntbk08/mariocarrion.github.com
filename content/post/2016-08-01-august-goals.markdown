I must confess July passed by faster than any of the previous months, not sure why yet. So with July completed I need go back to the drawing board, review what I did right and what I did not. In July I planned the following:

1. Finish reading *Go in Action*: [Successfully completed]({{< relref "2016-07-15-go-in-action.markdown" >}}).
1. Read **at least** two more books: Those two books I planned to finish reading are *Go Web Programming*, about 50% complete, and *Amazon Web Services in Action*, about 95% complete, this one shouldn't take more than a couple of days. 
1. Have [dynamic docker composer](https://github.com/mariocarrion/dynamic-docker-composer) ready: This is still a work in progress, but I did push some code and I actually integrated it with Travis and CodeClimate, so that's good.

What I want to accomplish this August is, obviously, what I did not accomplish in July, so again: finish those two books and at least 2 more, and continue working on *dynamic docker composer*.
