> A cue. A routine. A reward.

Today I completed one of the books I meant to complete in July: [The Power of Habit](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0055PGUYU/), written by [Charles Duhigg](http://charlesduhigg.com/) and published by Random House in 2012.

One of my goals [this year]({{< relref "2017-01-01-year-plans.markdown" >}}) is to nurture my non-technical side. That has driven me to read about [theology]({{< relref "2017-05-09-as-a-man-thinketh.markdown" >}}), [self-improvement]({{< relref "2017-04-16-the-one-thing.markdown" >}}) and psychology in the recent months.

**The Power of Habit** does not sell you a unique idea for changing your habits or *one-fits-all* magic recipe you can follow to change the way you behave, instead it tries to explain your current behavior is caused by a combination **cue-&gt;routine-&gt;reward**, it does that by narrating different unrelated stories where habits made a significant impact on the way they eventually developed.

From a patient with memory loss, an alcoholic, an addicted gambler or a murderer, the stories in **The Power of Habit** explain you how one tiny thing eventually led to another huge thing. 

What is important to take from those stories is not the actual story itself but **how everything started to happen**, because in the end whatever behavior you're trying to change it did not start out of nowhere, _**something** triggered it in first place, you did something next and then it became a routine, a **habit**_.

_Seeing things out of the box_ is such a cliche thing to say, but after completing **The Power of Habit** the way I see things changes significantly.

**The Power of Habit** is a long read, but I highly recommend it to anyone trying to become a better person, improve his/her life, overcome bad habits or create new healthy habits.
