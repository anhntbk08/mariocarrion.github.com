Following the [_Building Microservices_]({{< relref "2017-10-11-building-microservices.markdown" >}}) reading-trend, I just finished reading **Building Microservices with Go**, a much more Go-oriented _Building Microservices_ book, which, not surprisingly, complements the one I read before.

[**Building Microservices with Go**](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-microservices-go) is a, relative, brand new book. It was published in July 2017 by Packt and brings a lot of specific Go (and not Go) ideas related to creating microservices. 

Similar to other books, it distributes the examples via Github, all the chapters have a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/building-microservices-with-go). The content overlaps nicely with all the previous books I've read so far this year (and before), it suggest a bunch of cool new libraries and projects like:

* [validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator): struct validator
* [gziphandler](https://github.com/NYTimes/gziphandler): gzip middleware
* [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify): mocks
* [go-resiliency](https://github.com/eapache/go-resiliency): resiliency patterns, like short circuit.
* [The Pragmatic Logging Handbook](https://www.loggly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/loggly_ebook_Pragmatic_Handbook_online.pdf)

Plus some really nice tools:

* [benchcmp](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp)
* [megacheck](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/megacheck)
* [SafeSQL](https://github.com/stripe/safesql)
* [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck)

I enjoyed **Building Microservices with Go**, it was a great complementary and really relevant read for Go. I'm not disappointed.
