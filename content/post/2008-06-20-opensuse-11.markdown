  content: unfortunately, my openSUSE 11 stickers wore out really quickly.  The one
    on my laptop is basically just a white sticker already.  Hopefully you have better
    luck!

<p>I'm sure everyone already knows that <a title="OpenSUSE 11" href="http://news.opensuse.org/2008/06/19/announcing-opensuse-110-gm/" target="_blank">OpenSUSE 11</a> has been released, if you don't then you are literally living in other world. Anyway, I've received my copy today and it includes two beautiful stickers:</p>
<p>One for my laptop and the other for my door:</p>
