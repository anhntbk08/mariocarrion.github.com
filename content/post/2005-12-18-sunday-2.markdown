<p>After thinking for a while I decided to upgrade to <a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperDrake">Dapper</a>, after downloading the packages and logging in for testing the newest changes in <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>, the first thing I noticed is the faster loading and lowing memory usage, <strong>only 88-90MB</strong> for the GNOME Desktop! Awesome!</p>

<p>I'm also testing Gaim 2, looks very nice... ;-)</p>

<p>This recent upgrade, upgraded Xorg... now when typing the entire session flashes... looks like a broken TV... but only when typing... really weird...</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED.</strong> Horizontal/vertical sync related problem... don't know.. but with 1280x1024 resolution.. doesn't seems to work... 1024*768 does the trick, must wait for updates.</p>
