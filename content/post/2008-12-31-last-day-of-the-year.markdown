<p>Another year is almost gone. I can't say 2008 year was "<em>another year</em>", actually I think 2008 is the most exciting and interesting year I ever lived. I joined a <a title="Novell" href="http://www.novell.com/linux" target="_self">great company</a> and I've been working with a <a title="Mono UIA Team" href="http://www.mono-project.com/Accessibility:_Team" target="_blank">great group</a>. I'm looking forward next year.</p>
