<p>In the next days I'm going to move all our files and databases to our new hosting. I want to thank you to <a href="http://www.enzolutions.com/">Eduardo "Enzo" Garcia</a> because he was sponsoring our hosting these past years. Thank you so much, I mean it. </p>
<p>Due to new hosting, accessing to this blog may change, to something like http://www.monouml.org/mario or alike, still don't know, because the new host haven't yet created my username maybe because haven't pay him :P, anyway, let's see what happens in next days.</p>
<p>By the way, many people is complaining about Novell Forge SVN server, you know, because is down, <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/newsportal/article.php?group_id=1011&msg_id=502&group=novell.forge.forge.public">I'm reading</a> that service will be up tomorrow, so let's get ready!</p>
