[The Obstacle is The Way](http://theobstacleistheway.com/) is the second book written by Ryan Holiday I've read so far, the first one was [Ego Is the Enemy]({{< relref "2017-04-06-ego-is-the-enemy.markdown" >}}) back in April, and similar to the last one, _The Obstacle is The Way_ does not disappoint.

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference.

_The Obstacle is The Way_ was published two years before _Ego is The Enemy_, in 2014, and to put it in practical terms it focus on changing our point of view regarding the problems you face on a daily basis, whether it is something really happening or something you think is happening. 

Similar to _Ego is The Enemy_, _The Obstacle is The Way_ has three big sections: _Perception_, _Action_ and _Will_; and each section contains anecdotes from different people, including politicians, businessmen and philosophers. 

The fundamental idea in _The Obstacle is The Way_ is [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism). The idea of **not allowing** our fears and obstacles control the way we behave, but instead accept and, more importantly, face them head-on to become a better person. 

_The Obstacle is The Way_ includes a quote, not literal, that my mother used to say to me when I was younger:

> There is a remedy for everything except death.

**That** is the ultimate truth.

We should never allow our perception cloud our problems, to make them bigger than they are.

What does not kill you, makes you stronger.
