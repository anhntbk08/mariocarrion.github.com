<p>After debugging, tracing and profiling, I squashed <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2006/10/18/unit-tests/">that awful bug</a> and some others that were less awful, now am starting the improvement of every server, you know remove those memory leaks, write manual pages and beautify not-written-by-myself code.</p>
<p>And am also working in the free software world, by porting jHotdraw to C#, so don't forget to <a href="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/viewsvn/monouml/trunk/monocanvas-current/">check it out</a>!</p>
