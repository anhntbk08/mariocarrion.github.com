<p>I spent, yesterday, half-day receiving an explanation of my newest project at work, will spend one year coding a new C-and-C#-based application and, if everything goes nice, will code in Linux rather than QNX, I would love doing it in Linux, but both are nice OSs to play with.</p>
<p>In the other side I've, finally, set my xorg.conf to act as older, when I was able to scroll using touchpad, now click-and-move for selecting works and scroll also does, the trick is here:</p>
<pre>Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier    "Synaptics Touchpad"
	Driver        "synaptics"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	Option        "Device"        "/dev/psaux"
	Option        "Protocol"        "auto-dev"
	Option "Edges" "1900 5400 1900 4000"
	Option "Finger" "25 40"
	Option "MaxTapTime" "180"
	Option "MaxTapMove" "110"
	Option "MaxDoubleTapTime" "210"
	Option "TapTime" "10"
	Option "ClickTime" "0"
	Option "EmulateMidButtonTime" "75"
	Option "VertScrollDelta" "100"
	Option "MinSpeed" "0.20"
	Option "MaxSpeed" "0.18"
	Option "AccelFactor" "0.0010"
	Option "Emulate3Buttons" "false"
EndSection</pre>
<p>You also need:</p>
<pre>Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
	Screen		"Default Screen"
	InputDevice	"Generic Keyboard"
<strong>	InputDevice	"Synaptics Touchpad" "AlwaysCore"</strong>
EndSection</pre>
