<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://hgmiguel.blogspot.com">w</a><a href="http://carloshit.blogspot.com/">e</a> spent our time creating, painting and pasting some scenery elements for the regional contest at <a href="http://www.itver.edu.mx">my U</a>, we will use a jungle-like theme for our little space at the contest, some <em>coconuts</em>, some <em>palm trees</em> and of course our <em>monkey</em> swinging while grabbing the UML-cube are currently finished.</p>
<p><a href="http://carloshit.blogspot.com/">Carlos</a> took some pictures while the creation, I really liked the paper-based monkey, it looks too nice, we haven't paint it at all. We will do it tomorrow. There are still missing some palm trees to do and some other minimal details.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th is the day.</p>
