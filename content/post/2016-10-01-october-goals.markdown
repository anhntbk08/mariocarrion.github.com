Three more months before reaching 2017! What a ride. Let's see what I planned to accomplish in [September]({{< relref "2016-09-01-_sept-2016.markdown" >}}):

### Read _at least_ two books

I did accomplish this, I finished reading [Docker In Practice]({{< relref "2016-09-19-docker-in-practice.markdown" >}}) and [Orchestrating Docker]({{< relref "2016-09-23-orchestrating-docker.markdown" >}}); I'm still working on finishing reading _Go Web Programming_, I got totally sidetracked studying for [my test]({{< relref "2016-09-30-last-two-weeks.markdown" >}}).

### Hack more Dynamic Docker Composer

Failed this one, I didn't spend time working on _DDC_; this month I will go back, I have to.

### What am I planning for October?

Finish reading the _Go Web Programming_ book, as well as _Go in Practice_ and _Go Programming Blueprints_, hack more _Dynamic Docker Composer_ and push my blogging even more, I will try to publish a post once a week, talking about what I did that week, I hope I can.
