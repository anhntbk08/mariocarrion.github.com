Today was the official _first_ day of GopherCon. The conferences day to put it someway (but was my second one!). I arrived early because I assumed the breakfast lines will be similar to the ones we had yesterday for lunch, and considering it was only "half" the expected attendees I really wanted to make sure I avoided not having enough food.

After having breakfast, and before the first talk, I was able to explore the exhibitors booths, I got some really cool Gopher pins from the Microsoft booth:

Then the conferences officially started, the first talk was **The Scheduler Saga** by [Kavya Joshi](https://twitter.com/kavya719), it was phenomenal, I recall watching her talk [about channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZlN0izeiY), that one was great as well. Kavya as expected did a great job describing the internals of the scheduler, explaining everything in such a simple terms.

Next was **An Over-Engineering Disaster with Macaroons** by [Tess Rinearson](https://twitter.com/_tessr), I was a bit curious about this one since I read the agenda, and silly me I thought it was really about the french cookies (doh!), but I quickly realized this _macaroons_ thing was a reference to the old well known _browser cookies_, I did learn something for sure.

Next, we got a surprise announcement from Russ Cox (via a video projected to all the audience) regarding Go 2 and the efforts to improve Error Handling and Generics. Interesting stuff:

I took a long break to explore the other exhibitor booths, I was able to get more stickers and talk to some of them, the DataDog and BugSnag people were friendly and the registry solution by jFrog was really interesting.

After that I attented **How Do you Structure your Go Apps** by [Kat Zien](https://twitter.com/kasiazien), she covered some of the possible ways to structure Go code, not surprisingly the one she seems to recommend is the Onion/Hexagonal Architecure.

Then I went to attent **Allocator Wrestling** by [Eben Freeman](https://twitter.com/_emfree_), which described ways to write Go code so it _helps_ the Garbage collector, plus some cool techniques for profiling code to measure and improve performance.

After that I attended **Rethinking Classical Concurrency Patterns** by [Bryan C. Mills](https://github.com/bcmills), this one was quite interesting because it revisited all the common concurrency patterns in Go, Bryan went through the code snippets quickly so watching this talk again a few times over is requried for everything to sink in.

Finally the last talk was **Computer Vision Using Go and OpenCV 3** by [Ron Evans](https://twitter.com/deadprogram), I was already familiar with one, Ron gave this talk at at [GothamGo 2018]({{< relref "2018-04-27-gotham-go-2018.markdown" >}}), again it did not dissapoint.

Next I took a tiny break to have dinner, then I attended the _Welcome Party_ at the [**Denver Performing Arts Complex**](http://www.artscomplex.com/), I listened to the [GopherCon band](https://twitter.com/search?q=gopherconband&lang=en) and enjoyed a few drinks.

What a fun day was Day 2. I must to say that.
