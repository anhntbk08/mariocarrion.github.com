<p>Days ago <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2006/02/19/tango/">I wrote</a> about using a tango-based desktop. I really like a blue-like desktop, there is <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-83009.html">a post</a> in ubuntu forums that explains how to change the default usplash image and some other things in desktop to show it as blue-like one. I'm one of those people who don't like default theme and enjoy using blue-based themes, the better of using free software is this that if you don't like it you can always change it.</p>
<p>Don't forget <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=29962">GRUB theme</a>.</p>
<p>BTW. Don't they look nice?.</p>
