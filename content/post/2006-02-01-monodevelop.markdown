<p>You may be some of those people who don't like <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a> because think that MonoDevelop crashes when you are coding very well or because MonoDevelop uses a lot of memory... if so then you are using a very older version!!! I'm running from svn and everytime after updating I smile because of the new improvements, am very glad of seeing this changes.</p>
<p>MonoDevelop has a lot of interesting things, the most a like is the Version Control plugin, (enable it with <em>--enable-versioncontrol</em> parameter when configuring). If you change something in a svn-based project you will notice after its saving that the Solution icon changes for indicating its state.</p>

<p>If you open your <em>ChangeLog</em> file you can even add your entries in one automatic way, using the its entry at the MenuBar.</p>
