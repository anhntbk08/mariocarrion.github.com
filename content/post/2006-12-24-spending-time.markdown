<p>Even today is a free day, am still working, at least I enjoy working by listening great music, older but greater.</p>

<p>By the way, I've found that current Amarok version (in Edgy) brokes my iPod when updating, but who cares, I don't use it anymore due to that older Banshee bug is fixed. Everything is nice and better.</p>
