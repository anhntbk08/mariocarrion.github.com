First book of the month has been completed, this time I decided to take a different topic for reading: Databases. [PostgreSQL Replication - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-replication-second-edition) it's a very technical book that feels like a really long blog post, kind of like a tutorial.

Do not get me wrong, I did like the book because it covers everything really well, it includes some educational background, concrete examples, tips and tricks and overall describes the most common and popular tools for Replicating in PostgreSQL.

Think of this book as the State of Art in Replication using PostgreSQL, specially because it is less than one year old. Really recommended for anyone trying to understand the different tools available for replication as well as the different use cases.
