<p>A friend of mine, <a href="http://carloshit.blogspot.com">Carlos</a>, visited me yesterday, we went to hang somewhere around to talk, to remember old times and to have fun, this happened until 04:00AM, quite nice.</p>
<p>He's doing some apps using newest MS's technology, showed me an application to write arbitrary-widgets based on its drawing called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/ ">Expression</a> using <a href="http://www.xaml.net/">XAML</a> mainly used in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windowsvista/ -">MS Windows Vista</a> with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFX">WinFX</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_%28API%29">Avalon</a> and so on, that XML-defined extension <a href="http://glade.gnome.org">remembered something</a> in our side.</p>
<p>BTW, while searching some english written phrases, I noticed <a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/phrasal-verbs/">a page</a> that includes severals phrases and their "definition", very usefull for me, a non-native english speaker, and learning some <em>never hurts</em>.</p>
