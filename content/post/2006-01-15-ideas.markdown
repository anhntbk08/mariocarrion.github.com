<p>I spent this weekend thinking about some many things, <em>monouml-things</em>. It all began after reading (days ago) <a target="_blank" title="Cherokee" href="http://alobbs.com/photolog/Cherokee_EL_PAIS">alo's post</a> when I notice that maybe taking <a target="_blank" title="Cherokee Web Server" href="http://www.0x50.org/">his effort</a> and wrapping the libraries would be nice for allowing GroupWare in <a target="_blank" title="MonoUML CASE Tool" href="http://www.monouml.org">MonoUML</a>, of course in the near future... we haven't yet finished MonoCanvas, but the ideas are nice. I talked with <a target="_blank" title="Rodolfo Campero" href="http://rodolfocampero.blogspot.com">Rodolfo</a>, telling this idea for using the WebServices-based communication, yes I know, WS aren't the best either... He suggested a better solution: <a target="_blank" title="CORBA" href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a>. I agree with him, but using CORBA adds another dependency, so does cherokee-wrapping... Anyway I just need to think more while implementing MonoCanvas.</p>
<p>There are some things that a want to upgrade, some of then are related to usability, such as better DnD within the Views, nicer UIs, better usage space... MonoUML needs love.</p>
