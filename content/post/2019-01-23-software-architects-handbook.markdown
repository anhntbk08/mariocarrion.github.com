[**Software Architect's Handbook**](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/software-architects-handbook) is a book written by [Joseph Ingeno](https://ingeno.io/) and published in August 2018 by Packt.

I like approaching Packt books with caution because sometimes the content seems rushed and lacks quality, and some others the content is good and polished, it's kind of a flip of coin with this publisher. I also like buying their books every time I see bundles or goods discounts, so there's that as well.

This time I was lucky enough to get **Software Architect's Handbook** for only $5. I was expecting something similar to [Architectural Patterns]({{< relref "2018-04-30-architectural-patterns.markdown" >}}), a book covering said topic but also a book all over the place. `I was wrong!` **Software Architect's Handbook** is definitely worth your time investment and really you should pay full price for it.

I like it takes the very best of other books I've read in the past, from new ones (like [Building Evolutionary Architectures]({{< relref "2018-03-01-building-evolutionary-architectures.markdown" >}}), [Microservices Patterns]({{< relref "2018-12-05-microservices-pattern.markdown" >}}) and [Microservices in Action]({{< relref "2018-11-01-microservices-in-action.markdown" >}})) to classic ones (like [Domain Driven Design](https://smile.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/)), it organizes correctly all that knowledge so you can get the best after reading it.

My personal highlights include dedicating chapters to cover:

* Security,
* Soft Skills, and
* Becoming a better Software Architect

Three important topics I rarely see mentioned in technical books, specially _Soft Skills_ which seems to be a huge problem in our industry.

Even if you're not a Software Architect nor you're looking to become one, you should read this book because it covers relevant topics that will help you immediately to become a better professional.

`Verdict` **Buy it!**
