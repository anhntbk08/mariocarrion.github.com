I didn't plan to read specific books [this september]({{< relref "2017-09-01-september-goals.markdown" >}}), however after reading [The Power of Habit]({{< relref "2017-08-15-the-power-of-habit.markdown" >}}) and [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]({{< relref "2017-09-05-the-7-habits.markdown" >}}) it really made a lot of sense to me to continue reading books related to building habits. That's how I found the [The Healthy Programmer](http://healthyprog.com/)

**The Healthy Programmer** is a book published by [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/book/jkthp/the-healthy-programmer) in 2013 that includes a collection of health tips tailored to programmers, to basically help you stay healthy while programming.

All the content in **The Healthy Programmer** is really simple to follow and a quick read, it includes a checklist of daily activities to follow which is easy to do. The content is relevant even though it was published 4 years ago because practically all the things related to how we do our work are still the same.

Since I finished reading it I started following the suggested exercises and completing the checklist every day, it's good practice I want to become a habit.
