[**Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang**](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-software-architecture-golang) is a book written by [Jyotiswarup Raiturkar](https://github.com/cookingkode/book) and published in December 2018 by Packt.

Finding good Software Architecture books in the market is though, specifically for an evolving programing language such as Go, to my surprise **Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang** delivers **relevant** content that helps you get an idea about what is like to using Go for designing and implementing scalable Software Architectures.

**Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang** touches a little bit of everything related to Software Architecture: Software Design, Design Patterns, Scalability Considerations, Messaging, Serialization and Database Design, just to mention a few.

The key differentiator in this book is the concrete _Go content_ included with the topic being covered, it explains the subject and a concrete Go library/program is referenced, for example in the case of Kafka [sarama](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama) appears, when talking about ElasticSearch [elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic) is mentioned, when talking about Hystrix [hystrix-go](https://github.com/afex/hystrix-go) is linked, just to mentioned a few.

That's why I initially mentioned **Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang** is useful regarding giving you an idea about Software Architecture with Go, because although you may be familiar with all those technologies already, having concrete implementations of those libraries is a great way to determine how feasible is the system you're trying to build.

One more important thing in this book is the mention of [go kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) (and therefore Microservices, Domain Driven Design and Bounded Context), which I personally find the most important thing when using Go as a Software Architecture, to keep the code idiomatic.

**Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang** is a must for Go Software Architects, also kind of relevant don't forget to watch Brian's talk [Bringing Go to the Enterprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxlJqrVSalY).
