<p>Working will always take time, in some cases all your time. Even I started to use <em>The Cycle System</em>, and it works, I started using it too late, but, will keep it doing it until finish everything.</p>
<p>One of the many plans I have for this year is to read, at least, one book every month, doesn't matter the kind of book read, will prefer reading development-related ones, but don't exclude those Sci-Fi-like books. I've read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-System-Administrators-Thomas-Limoncelli/dp/0596007833/sr=1-1/qid=1170732791/ref=sr_1_1/002-9883943-4929631?ie=UTF8&s=books">my first book</a> on January, and I'm doing it with February by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practices-Agile-Developer-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/097451408X/sr=8-1/qid=1170732528/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9883943-4929631?ie=UTF8&s=books">Practices of an Agile Developer</a>. That book is so great, it's a must-have book if you are developer and want to write better computer systems, libraries, APIs or whatever you like to call those software-like things.</p>
<p>I'm happy because after some months of waiting the <a href="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7327">OCL patch</a> has been applied to FreeDesktop's CVS; in some future you'll see "detected" OCL files in your system, if you are using <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=345911">GtkSourceview</a> then you may not have to wait too much ;-).</p>
<p>I will restart working on the Generics Reverse Engineering, have to. Generics are great and in the future, maybe, all C# code will reference them.</p>
<p>I would love to have more free time to do so.</p>
