It's time again to say *goodbye* to something I will never be able to bring back, although time is infinite, it is finite for you and it never comes back. 

A couple of nights ago, after migrating my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll I spent some time reading all the old posts, oh boy what a trip, specially because I wasn't aware anymore of the context of most of the posts, until of course I read them. It's crazy how time flies, how priorities change and how you feel about particular things after a couple of years.

That's why I wanted to write this post, I know is not technical at all, but I know in a couple of years, I will go back to read some of the old posts and I will read this one, and at that precise moment I will remember something about this wonderful year.

2014 has been great, I must say, I didn't plan anything this year, I went with the way, so to speak, and it's crazy because everything seems to be working the way is supposed to be working. I already have a lot of great plans for new year and I believe next year will be a really cool year, only time will tell.

I'm looking forward to experiencing 2015.
