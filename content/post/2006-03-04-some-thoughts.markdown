<p>I felt sick yesterday, because of the food, (I'm guessing) however I ate as usual, but minutes later began feeling dizzy and with kind of somer fever, that night: shaking and cold.. really weird, the day before I've got a headche, hope that those older-daily headches don't return, however need to rest. </p>
<p>Funny weekend. But at least I've printed the specifications, now I need to finish MonoCanvas...</p>
<p>I'm thinking in going to take a photography course, all the photos I took are awful, some are nice, but some others that include people moving around aren't nice... :-( Need to read some books or something, need to improve my poor phography-skills.</p>
