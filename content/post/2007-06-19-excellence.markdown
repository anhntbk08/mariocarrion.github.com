<p><em>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. </em>Aristotle</p>
<p>I decided, since the beginning of current year, to read at least one book per month, haven't done so due to I used to had a lot of work, isn't a excuse because I've finished reading four, so am on my way. I have to say really like the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf Series</a>, those books are very well written are so easy to read, they really rule, and of course you learn from them.</p>
<p>I love reading (and sleeping, eating and developing), you always have something to learn from books. I'm not in a race to read twelve books this year on the contrary am on a race to improve my software engineering skills, including of course management and development, learning "<em>new tricks</em>"  will always save you time.</p>
<p>I still don't know neither where to go and what to do in the near future, but am sure that knowledge will help me.</p>
