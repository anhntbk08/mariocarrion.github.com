Published by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/), [React.JS Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/reactjs-essentials) is my first introduction to React.JS, a less opinionated JavaScript library created by Facebook for building User Interfaces.

I decided to go the React way after using jQuery and KnockoutJS, and reaching a point where implementing UI elements using either of them became something extremely difficult, specially from the maintenance perspective, it felt like trying to use the incorrect tool for the job.

I like this book, it offers a great introduction to React, Jest and Flux, the examples are easy to follow and in practice the project used in the book makes sense, everything is explained correctly, to me it was the perfect introduction.

I plan to continue learning React, I even bought [React Quickly](https://www.manning.com/books/react-quickly) already, so more React coming this way!
