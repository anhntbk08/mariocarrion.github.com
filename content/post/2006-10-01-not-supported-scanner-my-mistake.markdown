<p>Due to the problem <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2006/09/30/going-back/">at hotel</a>, I needed to buy a scanner because of need to scan tickets send "real" signed letter to the bank... and I <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html#Z-HEWLETT-PACKARD">did it</a> and did it wrong, bought a <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/unsupported/hp-scanjet-2400c.html">non-supported one</a>! :( Why the hell didn't read the compatibility list!!</p>
<p>If there's no other option, will hack the SANE backend to use my not supported scanner.</p>
