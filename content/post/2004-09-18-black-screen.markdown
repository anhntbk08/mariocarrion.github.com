<p>Some time ago I took some pictures (<span style="font-weight:bold;">DO NOT ASK ABOUT QUALITY</span> I used the Zire's built-in camera) about something weird that happened. I was watching TV, watching one TV channel and then another and then another and so on, but something caught me the eye, a nice and pretty <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/mswindows1.jpg',645,485)">windows' black death screen</a> (I took another <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/mswindows2.jpg',645,485)">two</a> <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/mswindows3.jpg',645,485)">shots</a>) that remembered me the old windows' blue screen which always used to appear while you were reading any website using <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape Communicator 4.7</a> or chatting with your <a href="http://www.mirc.com">IRC  client</a> for Windows 95, nice thoughts.</p>
<p>I miss my modem's speed, the lowest ever, and those faster computers called 486 and those really big black diskettes, the time had passed too fast, I used to run Windows 95 on my early beginning, I'm not proud for had been an old MS Windows user, old past years.</p>
<p>I'm impressed that Microsoft Windows is still the same, but now it uses more computer resources: more RAM, more hard disk space, and still has those nice features: hanging randomly and a lot of viruses. I don't miss any of Microsoft Windows' features. I miss the computer games, but nowadays I don't have enough time to play so I don't miss them either.</p>
<p>Recently, <span style="font-weight:bold;">the MonoUML Team</span>, had been thinking about writing our own diagramming canvas, due to diacanvas-sharp is still too immature for our purposes, we decided to choose GnomeCanvas, Mario Fuentes and I will code all those elements, new core elements will be written. Rodolfo added a new document <span style="font-weight:bold;">ARCHITECTURE</span>, he wrote it and I made the DocBook, it shows the core elements used in MonoUML, nice for those new people who will help sometime and useful for us too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today</span>: 'I'm going to travel in 2 hour and I haven't slept yet.'
