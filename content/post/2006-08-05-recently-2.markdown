<p>I've recently doing several things, first, at work, I've finally ported most of the SCADA from QNX to Linux by replacing all the <a href="http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/qnx_6.1_docs/neutrino/sys_arch/resource.html">Resource Managers</a> to Ring Buffer, wrote an implementation based on the producer-consumer problem, an implementation to an already solved problem.</p>
<p>Then, in the Free Software world, I'll travel to Puerto Vallarta, because of <a href="http://festivaldesoftwarelibre.org/fsl2006/">FSL2006</a>, went past year and will do travel again (hope so, due to work), this time to show how to develop mono-based applications. I haven't had enough time to prepare all the material, including the manual and so on but I've allready have the presentation only need to update it.</p>
<p>Oh man... I have a lot to do...!!</p>
