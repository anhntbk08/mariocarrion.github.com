<p>I had played a lot with my MMC/SD Card, I have it since almost one year ago, but until now I'm using it often. I didn't do anything nice this weekend, no technologies written. I spent this weekend downloading some nice MP3s, some newbies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Royal Gigolos - California Dreamin'</li>
<li>DJ Tiesto - Love comes again</li>
<li>Boogie Pimps - Somebody to love</li>
</ul>
<p>and some oldies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerman 5000 - When worlds collide</li>
<li>Slipknot - Wait and Bleed</li>
<li>Tool - Schism</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still looking for David Bowie - Little Wonder, I had it long time ago, but by now I missed it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today:</span> '<span style="font-style:italic;">Mario</span>: a cup of coffee please.'
