<p>I'm currently in the last part of my current <em>work-project</em>, now am creating the Debian packages for all the system. It isn't difficult, but you get tired very fast, it's been a week and I still have to create packages (20-25 more packages I guess), at least Monday is a free day, so I have time to do so.</p>
<p>I would love going to the movies, hope going tomorrow.</p>
