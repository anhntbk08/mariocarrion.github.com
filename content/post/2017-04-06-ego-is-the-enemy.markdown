Continuing with my personal theme of reading more non-technical self-improvement books tonight I completed reading [Ego is The Enemy](https://smile.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday-ebook/dp/B015NTIXWE/) a book written by _Ryan Holiday_ and published by [Portfiolio](http://www.penguin.com/publishers/portfolio/).

I'm surprised _Ego is The Enemy_ touches topics [The Extraordinary Leader]({{< relref "2017-03-27-the-extraordinary-leader.markdown" >}}) also references: _Self Control_ and _Humility_. I did not plan to read these books in this order but I'll take it.

_Ego is The Enemy_ is a collection of stories from _famous_ people, from politicians to actors, to athletes to warlords. Although a short book it is a really concise one, it is divided in 3 big sections: _Aspire_, _Success_ and _Failure_, each section having its own well paced collection of stories relevant to the main topic.

In the end _Ego is The Enemy_ reinforces what _The Extraornardy Leader_ somehow explicitly covered: _Be humble, listen and have self-control_.
