<p>Nowadays I been hacking MonoCanvas and recently I've been adding some things that reflect a correct <em>canvas-behaviour</em> such as to stop moving when reaching top-most and left-most position, I mean, negative canvas' positions are not allowed, to stop moving the shape isn't a real problem but when the shape has inner shapes, that's the real problem!</p>
<p>I'm scratching my head for allowing this correct behavior... </p>
<p>But when finished will be nicer! :-)</p>
