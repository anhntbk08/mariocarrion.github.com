<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>After being a lot of time at school and going and coming, I've recently solved my problem with my Social Service; my counselor agreed to talk with the main boss from that department, so now I can do the Social Service without filling all the requirements, I'm happy about that, now I'll face a very hard semester at school.</p>
<p>I'm also working with the <a href="http://monouml.sf.net">MonoUML</a>'s UML#, I've posted a new UML model for that package, and I'm doing a nice tutorial for using i18n with GetText# for the <a href="http://www.monohispano.org">MonoHispano</a> community, I'm close to finish it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will go to my girlfriend's graduation party, I'm ironing my shirt and here there's too hot, I haven't gone to a party like that since long time ago. There, at the party, I might met my father-in-law, my girlfriend's father, I hope I like him, I really hope so.</p>
<p>I learned today: 'If you are awaked don't even think about sleeping.'
