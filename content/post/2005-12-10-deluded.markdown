<p>This beginning of month I've learn (or is it understood?) many things, most important are related to the fact that I ussually get trust myself and plan things that almost all the time doesn't happend, and this occurs because I plan too much and I wait for the right time, I think is correct... (this has been happend since ... four years ago... I need to switch strategy)</p>
<p>Besides I've notice that these days I've converted in a <em>deluded person</em>, lets get the facts</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking for talking for <em>maybe</em> solving our issues... Oh man! What the fuck was I thinking? Was fake... really fake.. Some time ago I said... <em>no more wasting time</em>, now I'm cleaning out.</li>
<li>Thinking that two days will suffice for solving some university-related papers... two days were few days... I spent all the week there... What does that mean? I need to go the work for weekends at least two.</li>
<li>Imaging the money will last this month, I didn't asked too much.. only a month!! However I paid some things I owed, I'm better now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to develop with real programming languages... Using Delphi and VB.NET is a pain in the ass.		</p>
