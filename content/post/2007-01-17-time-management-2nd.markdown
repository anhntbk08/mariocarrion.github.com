<p>I've finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007833/002-9883943-4929631">Limoncelli's book</a>, and I have to say that I agree with all the things he wrote, even started to use <em>his Cycle System</em> in my workday and it seems to work,  I go home happy with many things <em>managed</em>, am starting to think what to do with my free time, maybe learning Photography or learning any other programming language, maybe Python. To learn Photography I need a good camera and to learn Python I need some books, it seems I have things to learn.</p>
