  content: You don't necessarily need to buy some books to learn Python. The official
    tutorial is very good, and there is some other books like "Dive into Python" that
    are available for free.

  content: Time ago read the official one and yes it's quite complete, however I prefer
    reading on paper, but I'll take your suggestion and will start reading the online
    one.

<p>I've finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007833/002-9883943-4929631">Limoncelli's book</a>, and I have to say that I agree with all the things he wrote, even started to use <em>his Cycle System</em> in my workday and it seems to work,  I go home happy with many things <em>managed</em>, am starting to think what to do with my free time, maybe learning Photography or learning any other programming language, maybe Python. To learn Photography I need a good camera and to learn Python I need some books, it seems I have things to learn.</p>
