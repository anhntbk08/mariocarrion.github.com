<p>I've finally decided to stop wasting my time thinking in older issues, I need finishing <strong><a href="http://www.monouml.org/mediawiki/index.php/MonoCanvas">really importating things</a></strong>, things that are for me. No more memories will bother my feelings nowadays.</p>
<p>... this end-of-year I'll do something different, this year must be better, no more wasting of time. I would like going to see some friends that I haven't seen since years, I really would like to do it, I hope having some time for that.</p>
<p>I'm applying the same older solution: <strong>remove all and restart from the bottom</strong>, worked in past years, and should work now. I was wrong, but you are worse. I feel kind of disappointed.</p>
