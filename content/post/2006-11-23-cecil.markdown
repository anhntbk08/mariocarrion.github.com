<p>After implementing the Reverse Engineering's EngineManager to load assembly engines and read settings file, am starting to "port" the older System.Reflection based API to Mono.Cecil, there are a lot of similarities and a lot of differences, however reading its comments on <a href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/cecil/lib/Mono.Cecil/TypeAttributes.cs?view=markup">its source code</a> helps.</p>
<p>Finally know the date for travelling, will travel December 4th, hoping staying in Buenos Aires instead of Campana, will see it later.</p>
