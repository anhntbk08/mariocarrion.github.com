<p>Nokia 770 doesn't have (right now... or I haven't found it) a user-friendly client for twitter and for some unknown reason you can't post through the <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> web page. After googling I found a <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Apps">website</a> that includes a list of twitter clients. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mitter/">mitter</a> seems to be in the future the <em>default</em> twitter client because their plans include to port to <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a> and use <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Hildon">Hildon</a>, but not now; so if you are planning to post from your device then you have to figure it out.</p>
<p>Finally, after trying I found a solution by using the power of vim and its <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2124">plugins</a>, of course you will need to install <strong>vim</strong> and <strong>curl</strong> packages in your device to allow twittering from it.</p>
<p>By the way, don't forget that the <em>BACK</em> button (the button below the arrows left the screen) in your device acts as <em>ESC</em> key.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008-03-07</strong>: If you add the twitter user to your gtalk you will be able to twitter by sending him messages, nice isn't it?</p>
