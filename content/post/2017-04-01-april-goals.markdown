My [favorite month of the year]({{< relref "2016-04-01-april-2016-goals.markdown" >}}): **April**, is here!

Having [learned from February]({{< relref "2017-03-01-march-goals.markdown" >}}), I decided to set clear and concise goals last month. In March I did accomplish what I planned, so no underestimation at all either, what I planned was completed.

## Professionally

I've been working more and more on Go-related projects, and I've been enjoying every single part of it, I need to come up (**for real!**) with a personal project that really engages me so I can spend time on my own coding using Go. I know I already have [templenv](https://github.com/MarioCarrion/templenv) but to tell the truth the project is practically _feature complete_ so I have _nothing else_ to add.

Also, as usual, Ruby was also part of March and on that front I learned about the [bypass rescue]({{< relref "2017-03-29-til-bypass-rescue.markdown" >}}) option in Rspec.

### Personally

I finished reading all the planned books:

* [AWS Lambda in Action]({{< relref "2017-03-04-aws-lambda-in-action.markdown" >}})
* [Go Design Patterns]({{< relref "2017-03-24-go-design-patterns.markdown" >}}), and
* [The Extraordinary Leader]({{< relref "2017-03-27-the-extraordinary-leader.markdown" >}})

and **also** I already started reading _Ego Is The Enemy_, really cool book by the way, I should complete that one this first week of April.

### What am I planning for April 2017?

Complete the following books:

* Ego Is The Enemy,
* The ONE Thing, and
* Neo4j in Action.

Related to Neo4j I have to do some R&D for what I believe will be a huge differentiator in our proprietary platform.
