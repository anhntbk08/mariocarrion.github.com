<p>Nowadays I'm using <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy">Ubuntu Edgy</a> on the desktop, and <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/">Debian Sid</a> on the laptop, I use <a href="http://www.banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> for <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">iPod</a> sychronizing in both computers, however, after upgrading Banshee to 0.11, everything seems to be too slowly, loading takes forever and switching between playlist drives my crazy, I've opened a <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360824">bug</a> telling this. I'm not the only only facing this problem, <a href="http://carloshit.blogspot.com/">Carlos</a> has this problem too, so I'm not crazy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile will use Amarok, looks very nice, has a lot of options, is iTunes-like, and seems to work with my device.</p>
