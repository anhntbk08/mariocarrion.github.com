<p>I've been "unplugged" for... maybe 5 months, maybe less, maybe more, however, after reading Mono's most recent release, am building it from sources, I really want to get full involved in free software, however spent time at work tires me and when arrive home I don't want to code anymore... even I really love software development, need to plan my free time, scheduling usually seems to work.</p>
