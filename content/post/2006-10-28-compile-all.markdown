<p>I usually use both mono-svn-version and mono-release versions to test new features and live in the edge. Compiling every module takes time, so I decided to write a bash script to do that, the automated-way.</p>
<p>I will add it tomorrow afternoon to <a href="http://www.monohispano.es">MonoHispano</a>'s SVN, or until <a href="http://forge.novell.com">Novell</a>'s server bring back to life, in the meanwhile <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/files/compile_all.sh">the source</a> is uploaded. If there is any problem with the script, please let me know.</p>
