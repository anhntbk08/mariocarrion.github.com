<p>Using Templates is supported by <a href="http://numl.sourceforge.net">nUML</a>, so after doing some refactoring to current CIL plugin, you can see the results:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/811706599/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1250/811706599_2d16be1c0f_m.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="New CIL plugin" /></a></p>
<p>However there's missing the Tab-specific widgets for editing this Template information.</p>
