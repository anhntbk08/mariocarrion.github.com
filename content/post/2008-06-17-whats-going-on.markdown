<p>It's been awhile since my last <em>real post</em> (more than a few words I mean).</p>
<p>I'm not dead, I've been very busy moving from Mexico to US, looking for a good deal to get a great place in Boston, and I did it. I moved to Boston about two weeks ago. I like here, I mean, the office is usually very quiet and my apartment has great view and I have almost everything just around the corner, I even like the weird <a href="http://www.thebostonchannel.com/weather/index.html">weather</a>.</p>

<p>And my cubicle has windows! I like having sunlight, and because of the airport I usually see airplanes, pigeons and doves and sometimes you can even see <a title="Zeppelin NT" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeppelin_NT" target="_blank">Zeppelins</a> flying around. I would be lying if I said that has always liked sunlight, but after months of being in a <a title="Dungeon!!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon" target="_blank">Dungeon</a> (not literally) I realized that having a window is very important for being productive.</p>

<p>I'll be adding my <em>personal touch</em> to my cubicle, you know, hanging stuff, using some posters, etcetera, in the following days, I still have plenty of free space.</p>

<p>I'm still missing some home furniture, I think don't need too many, but who knows. Anyway, let's continue!</p>
