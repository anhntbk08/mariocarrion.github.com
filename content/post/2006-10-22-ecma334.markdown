<p>I'm still updating our older effort to translate ECMA334 to spanish, now we are quite far away from current specification, however there are less than 30 files missing to finally finish this translation, in the meanwhile, am updating older code written by <a href="http://fseoane.net">Fabian</a>, <a href="http://rodolfocampero.blogspot.com">Rodolfo</a> and some others anonymous hackers to compile with newer Gtk#. </p>

<p>Still need to autool the module, now works with hardcoded makefiles. I still have things <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/applications-todo/">to do</a>.</p>
