**Neo4j in Action** is my introduction to Graph databases, sadly I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed, not about Graph Databases themselves but more about this book, it is my fault because I knew it was an old one, and I bought it anyways.

_Neo4j in Action_ is a book published by Manning Publications in 2014 and it is a _long read_, it took me about 2-3 weeks of commute time to complete, so about 15 hours give or take. Examples are in Java except for those cases where Cypher is used, it coverts the different available server modes, how to properly build a graph, including indexes and labels as well as some other Neo4j-relevant configurations when planning to run in production.

_Neo4j in Action_ is not a total waste, don't get me wrong, but I had high hopes.

In the end this is the beginning of my personal research about Graph Databases, I must read more recent **Neo4j** documentation to make sure I'm up to date, next time I will be reading about [JanusGraph](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph) to continue with this research.
