<p>Days ago was trying to install <a href="http://www.ipodlinux.org/">Linux</a> on my iPod, however several disk-like errors didn't allow me to do so, at the end I finished with a full iPod unable to play any music file, to fix it request a partner to "format" it through iTunes on his Windows computer, he also updated the firmware to 1.2, now am not able to play anything seems that current libgpod is broken or something, neither <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">amarok</a>, <a href="http://banshee-project.org/Main_Page">banshee</a> nor <a href="http://www.gtkpod.org/about.html">gtkpod</a> are working, tomorrow will downgrade to 1.1.</p>
