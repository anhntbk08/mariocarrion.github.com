<p>Today I went to get my equipment: boots,  helmet, lens and earing protection, I won't use them too much but... I might. Monday will be my first day, I feel nervous, kind of, not about the job itself but I'm worried about the early begining... I just don't like to wake up to early, anyway I have to.</p>
<p>However I've finished my report for <a href="http://www.itver.edu.mx">my University</a>, I also installed <a href="http://maestria.itver.edu.mx/egresados/">the application</a>. I want to write some code... but I've been spending my free time seeing some movies... some TV shows... some plays...</p>
<p>I need to finish MonoCanvas' third draft for starting its implementation, I haven't enough time... I must start tonight... in my last free day :-)</p>
