[Streaming Data](https://www.manning.com/books/streaming-data) is practically a brand _new_ book, it was published a few months back in May 2017, I originally bought the MEAP version but I waited for the final version to start reading it, it was worth the wait. Streaming Data was written by _[Andrew G. Psaltis](https://twitter.com/itmdata)_ and it was published by Manning.

_Streaming Data_ cements all the knowledge I got from experience and reinforces all the best practices I've been applying for a few years already. It does a phenomenal work introducing the whole _Streaming Data_ cycle, it provides specific examples about what software to use on each step and what is more important it dedicates a whole chapter to each specific step.

The only _bad_ thing about _Streaming Data_ is the last chapter where a working example is presented to explain how to capture and process streaming data. To be honest this is not a deal breaker, I'm just not fond of full code examples in books, those always are my less favorite thing.

_Streaming Data_ is great and perfect if you're in the process of accepting high speed data (spoiler alert: give [Firehose Kinesis]({{< relref "2016-11-07-amazon-kinesis-one-month-later.markdown" >}}) a try!) in a way it complements [Big Data](https://www.manning.com/books/big-data).

Great book read it.
