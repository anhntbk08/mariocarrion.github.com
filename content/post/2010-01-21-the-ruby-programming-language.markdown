    lead me to C#. The syntax of C# was just as pretty as ruby, and I loved the statically
    typed and compiled language stuff. Strange thing that I am now learning Java.

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/4294063393/" title="Ruby by Mario Carrion, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2758/4294063393_54d8564980_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Ruby" /></a></p>
<p>A couple of days ago I finished reading: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177">The Ruby Programming Language</a>, book written by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto. If I have to say anything about the book and, the language, of course, is: I am impressed. The syntax is pretty for writing and simple for reading. Its simplicity makes you understand the code, is like visualizing the goal of the program in your mind by reading it, not running it. It is like reading a well written letter. You just understand.</p>
<p>I must say, when I was reading the book, at the beginning. I did not feel comfortable with the weird, at that time, syntax. Method decorations such as <em>"!"</em> and <em>"?"</em>, and the support for methods aliases made no sense. Actually I thought I was wasting my time by trying to learn the language. I was wrong.</p>
<p>When I learned C++ several years ago, I did not have reference to object orientation or any object-oriented programming language. Learning it was difficult, but, at the same time, easy. Difficult because I did not know the paradigm, easy because it was my first time learning that kind of syntax. After learning C++ I decided to learn Java and after that, I decided to learn C#.</p>
<p>And I learned them all the same way. I <em>"translated"</em> the syntax. Translated it from the <em>"new language"</em> to the <em>"old language"</em>. I did learn them all. And I thought, for long time, that the rule was: <em>"Learn all the languages the same way: by translation"</em>. I was wrong. Again.</p>
<p>Learning a new programming language, in my opinion, is better when you do not translate the new language. Similar to learn to speak a new language. In both cases, you have <strong>to think in the language</strong>. I decided to think in the new language. To do it that way. The Ruby way. The results were amazing. Were so amazing that inspired me to write <a href="http://github.com/mariocarrion/pulque">a project</a> in Ruby. I wanted to try out the syntax, the platform and the community. To see if the language was that good as I thought. </p>
<p>After trying it out. No disappointments at all. Actually is interesting that C# and Ruby share a lot of things, syntactically speaking. Both of them are pretty languages. Probably they do not share goals. However, I'm sure they share one goal: to make the life of the software developer easier. And, to a software developer, a programming language, and everything around it, that makes your life easier is what matters the most.</p>
