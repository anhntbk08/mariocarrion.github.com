[Monitoring Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/monitoring-docker) is book written by Russ McKendrick and published by Packt Publishing in 2015.

I got this one during the holiday sale for only $5, good deal if you ask me. _Monitoring Docker_ is all about tools for monitoring Docker containers (obviously), sadly it is kind of short and for the _technology standards_, kind of old already, however, surprisingly, the tools mentioned in the book are still available and nothing has really changed that much.

Most of the tools mentioned in the book are not really specific to Docker containers, yes you can use them for monitoring containers, but that's not their main goal. _Monitoring Docker_ is a quick read and shouldn't take you longer than a few hours to complete.

In the end my key only takeaway is the introduction of [Sysdig](http://www.sysdig.org/) and Sysdig Cloud.
