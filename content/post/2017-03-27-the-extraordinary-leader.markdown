Compared to the [previous book]({{< relref "2017-03-24-go-design-patterns.markdown" >}}), [The Extraordinary Leader](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B018T5PF84) is a extremely short one, I think it took me less than two hours to complete, not that being short is a bad thing but it does feel kind of weird to complete a book this quick.

_The Extraordinary Leader_ is a book written by _Serena Richards_ published in 2015. This book marks the beginning of a series of _non-technical_ books I will be reading this year, mostly focusing on things I want to improve to become a better Project Manager and Technical Leader. _The Extraordinary Leader_ covers similar subjects included in books I read previously like [Elastic Leadership]({{< relref "2016-12-08-elastic-leadership.markdown" >}}) and [Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RTYMOQS), however it does add a tiny thing that got stuck in my head: **self control** and the importance of having it to become a great leader.

In the end _The Extraordinary Leader_ is a good and short reading that complements the similar books, I do believe a bit more of content would have been nice maybe a few real-life examples.
