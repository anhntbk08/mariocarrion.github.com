<p>Finally I've bought that <a href="http://global.acer.com/products/monitor/1_series.htm">Acer Widescreen Monitor</a> was looking for, great monitor:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/408451887/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/408451887_33c4207527_m.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Acer AL1973W" /></a></p>
<p>In case you were wondering about <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=49464">the wallpaper</a> I found it at <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">GNOME-Look</a>. By the way you haven't to do any weird Xorg setup, Ubuntu handles by yourself and it does it nice.</p>
