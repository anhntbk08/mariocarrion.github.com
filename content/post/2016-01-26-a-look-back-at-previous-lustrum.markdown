Five days ago Facebook reminded me, thanks to the [On This Day](https://www.facebook.com/help/439014052921484/) feature, about my first blog related to the [Ruby Programming Language]({{< relref "2010-01-21-the-ruby-programming-language.markdown" >}}).

This first blog post was written five years ago.

What I take from that reminder is not only the fact that Ruby is the programming language I've been using professionally and personally the most, but also the fact that I haven't learned anything new, and that makes me a little sad.

By that I don't mean *anything* new, of course I have learned a lot of things during this last five years. I don't mean that, I mean **something** I personally wanted to learn. Something that inspired me to write a bunch of code in my free time, to get involved with whatever community surrounding that new thing, stuff like that, basically doing something outside my regular obligatory daily job.

Granted **great** personal things happened to me in the last five years and having some personal free time was difficult. However that is not a real excuse, in the end I believe if you really want to do something you'll find the way to do it.

The truth is that I didn't start having these thoughts 5 days ago, I've been trying to improve myself since last year, but for whatever reason I didn't really have a real opportunity to do so.

As a matter of fact, I can consider 2015 as the year that started the ball rolling, because in 2015 I was able to read **20** new technical books, which is really nothing compared to what I used to read when I was in college, but again, that's a significant improvement from previous years.

So far this 2016, I already read 2, slow start that's for sure but I'm confident my previous year record will be broken. I already made a list of the books I want to complete, the list so far contains **66** technical books, which is a lot if you compare it to 2015, but hey daily commuting takes me at least 40 minutes and I can't let that free time to go to waste.
