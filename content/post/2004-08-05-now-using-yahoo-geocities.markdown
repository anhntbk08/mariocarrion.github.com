<p>I've been using for long time my yahoo's email but I've never used the new yahoo geocities since geocities exists by itself before its buying, long time ago some (6 years I think), now I decided to change from <a href="http://www.miarroba.com">webcindario</a> (which sucks) to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/">geocities</a> :), Yahoo Geocities allows to link directly my images, that's cool!.</p>
<p>I learned today: 'Run linux!'</p>
<p>By the way: 'My new PC didn't come... maybe in some months :('
