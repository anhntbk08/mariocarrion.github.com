<p>Time goes so fast, on 2004 I was studying and waiting for graduation. I would love to have that free time like those old days. Even three years had passed I still remember those great things that happened.</p>
<p>I can be more happier (sure everyone can). I need to change older things for newer, let's say my <a href="http://mario.monouml.org/index.php/2005/03/30/finalmente-2/">old laptop</a>, maybe leaving my house and starting living on my own, get a car meet some girls, learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography">something new</a>, I don't know, but am sure that next weekend will spend thinking about it (will be on vacation). I'm so tired mentally and resting will help me. I don't plan traveling or doing any <em>spectacular</em> things, just spend time with my family and going out on the morning, maybe to the beach, going to the movies, having great time. Breathing fresh air.</p>
