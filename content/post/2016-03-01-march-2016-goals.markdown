After yesterday's leap day, we can finally say March is here! Sadly as this month starts I have to say my [February goals]({% post_url 2016-02-01-febraury-2016-goals %}) were not accomplished. I failed last month, I was not able to finish reading the two books I planned to. That makes me sad but at the same time makes me realize reading at home after working all day is really difficult. Really difficult.

I'll make this month easier and realistic. I **will** finish reading **The Go Programming Language** book. I'm so close, I'm missing the last four chapters, which I believe are the most difficult and interesting in this book. I want to take my time reading and understanding those last chapters, because I feel those are fundamental things I have to understand clearly.
