[September]({{< relref "2017-09-01-september-goals.markdown" >}}) seems to be the month where I started to improve my health, at least that's my idea. How was September then?

### Professionally

_**The** Global Unification_ is still a work in progress, no real progress has made, except a few personal ideas that I want to implement soon, that's practically it. Ideally this month I will start working on that, we'll see.

### Personally

I completed 2 books last month: [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]({{< relref "2017-09-05-the-7-habits.markdown" >}}) and [The Healthy Programmer]({{< relref "2017-09-15-the-healthy-programmer.markdown" >}}); and almost completed [Building Microservices](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950358/).

I was able to make a post about [LUA]({{< relref "2017-09-25-lua.markdown" >}}), really relevant because I made some changes that made our most important Web Service about 50% faster, really cool stuff, I'm really happy with the results.

### What am I planning for October 2017?

Complete _Building Microservices_, read at least one more and work out at least 20 days.
