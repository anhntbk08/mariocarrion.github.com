<p>Great weekend, both my sisters and I spent two days of fun, going to different places on <a href="http://www.sixflags.com.mx/">Saturday</a> and <a href="http://www.mychemicalromance.com">Sunday</a>.</p>
<p>Summary: arrived to Mexico City at 05:00, ate breakfast and then went to the amusement park (all day there),  after eating on Sunday we went to the concert!. </p>
<p>BTW, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance">MCR</a> has a great show, they played the best of their last two albums, people went crazy... both boys and girls screaming, I barely can hear.</p>
