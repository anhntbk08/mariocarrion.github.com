<p>I don't know why but I feel very happy, too much coffee maybe, however, this night, like every night, I begin reading <a href="http://mx.planetalinux.org">planetalinux</a> and I notice a very beautifull t-shirt (I hope Jacob don't get mad at me because I took his photo)</p>

<p>Notice <a href="http://ministeriosjm.com/area51/~jacob/blog">Jacob</a>'s t-shirt! Powered by <a href="http://www.monouml.org">MonoUML</a> ;-). <strong>Pretty amazing!</strong></p>
