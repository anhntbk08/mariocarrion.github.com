<p>After talking with Rodolfo, we've agreed to split the project as we though before, these are the assigned tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Carrion (uml#, gui)</li>
<li>Rodolfo Campero (expertCoder), he had been working with expertCoder since March so he hope finish it soon</li>
<li>Mario Fuentes (uml#), he had been working with GNOME Canvas since time ago, now with diacanvas# he's trying to port to C# the Clock Example
   </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm starting to code the Graphical Interface, the <a href="http://monouml.sourceforge.net">MonoUML</a>'s draft, I have one week I hope finish it sooner; I'm also reading the DI Specification to get deeper with UML.</p>
<p>I learned yesterday: 'If I think too much I can't sleep at all'</p>
