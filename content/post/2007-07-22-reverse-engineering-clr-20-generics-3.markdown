<p>I'm one step closer (<a href="https://launchpad.net/monouml/+milestone/monouml-200707">and a week!!</a>) to release our newest Reverse Engineering CIL plugin, there are some things to change, such as to allow Lists as settings parameters, upgrade the MonoUML tab for editing Template parameters/bindings and some not-yet-found bugs, if any.</p>
