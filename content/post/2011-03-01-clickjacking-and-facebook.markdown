<p>Sometimes it amuses me how stupid and innocent we (humans) are. Detecting a scam when getting an email or receiving a call saying you won X amount of dollars is easy to tell. But when a friend is saying something is more complicated to detect the trick. Because it's your friend saying it and you somehow trust him/her. Right?</p>
<p>Tonight I noticed the following link on my Facebook wall:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariocarrion/5488140914/" title="Clickjacking by Mario Carrion, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5258/5488140914_8ed607ee8e.jpg" width="500" height="130" alt="Clickjacking" class="aligncenter"/></a></p>
<p>Yes the first thing you notice is the butt of what it looks like a "schoolgirl". It looks fishy after you see that lots of your friends liked that link. Is a really good meme or a trick. Anyway after googling <em>victorialinn@live.com</em> (the email included in the source code of the page) I found an <a href="http://blog.kotowicz.net/2010/10/dont-textinfo-fightingguyinfo-facebook.html">interesting analysis</a> of all this. It is so fascinating. Take your time to read that blog. Is really interesting.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I would lie to you by saying I didn't click it. I did it indeed. Naughty Mario I shouldn't had clicked it. But hey I'm a man!! The photo was depicting a schoolgirl. I had to click it!! :)</em></p>
