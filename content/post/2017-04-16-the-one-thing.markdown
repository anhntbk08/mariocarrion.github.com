> What is [The ONE Thing](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00C1BHQXK) you can do today such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?

**That** is the ONE thing: focus on **one** single thing at the time, the most important one.

_The ONE Thing_ is a book written by both _Gary Keller_ and _Jay Papasan_, and published in 2013 by [Bard Press](http://www.bardpress.com/).

_The ONE Thing_, I believe, in one way or another complements the content described in [The Compound Effect]({{< relref "2016-03-18-the-compound-effect.markdown" >}}). A lot of great takeaways:

* Doing the **most important** thing is what matters.
* Success is built over time, by _always_ doing the most important things, same idea in _The Compound Effect_.
* Personal life is the **much more** important than work.
* Time spent on a task eventually beats talent, again, same idea in _The Compound Effect_

* Do not be _afraid_ of saying **No**
* Time blocking in the morning, at least 4 hours to work on the most important thing at the time, **uninterrupted**.

Although I did not plan to read [Ego is the enemy]({{< relref "2017-04-06-ego-is-the-enemy.markdown" >}}) before _The ONE Thing_ or _The Compound Effect_, I find interesting similar topics are covered, in one way or another, by all them, kind of like _Great minds think alike_.
