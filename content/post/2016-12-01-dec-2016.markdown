This is it. Last month of 2016. I'm super excited because I believe I made some personal progress. Let's see what I planned last [November]({{< relref "2016-11-01-nov-2016.markdown" >}}):

## Finish reading "Go In Practice"

Completed during the [beginning of November]({{< relref "2016-11-02-go-in-practice.markdown" >}}), last of the Go series published by Manning.

## Finish reading "Go Programming Blueprints"

I did not even start reading it yet, the funny thing is that there is a new edition already published. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Hack "Dynamic Docker Composer"

I did _hack_ a little, the truth is that I decided to rename the project to *templenv* to make it much more generic, because it isn't only used for Docker Compose, it could be used for generating any dynamic file.

## Hack "Gitlab API integration"

I will pause working on this until I finish, for real, *templenv* which is a precondition for this project.

## Start "Gofication" at work

Slow progress, the truth is that because of the holiday season changing things is kind of risky, of instead of making production changes, I'm researching a lot and obviously reading a lot. I'm excited for 2017, I will change things.

### What am I planning for December?

Finish reading _Go Programming Blueprints_, _Elastich Leadership_ and rest, **rest a lot**.
