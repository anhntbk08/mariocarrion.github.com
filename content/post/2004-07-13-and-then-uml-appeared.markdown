<p>I've been working at my lastest project, the revolution for GNU developers =P. After reading and testing and compiling a lot of information I've understood the GNOME environment, the programming, the callbacks, all the related stuff, it is cool.</p>
<p>
I guess I've found my thesis project, a CASE tool for the GNOME environment. Maybe some day my project will be as part of the Debian project X).</p>
<p>
Talking with some people  (#gnome irc.gimp.net)  I've decided to choose the Python, why not mono? because.</p>
<p>
I learned:</p>
<p>
<code> function do() { <br />read;<br />compile;<br />test;<br />do(); }</code><code></code></p>
