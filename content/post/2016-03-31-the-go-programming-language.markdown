On [January 21st, 2010]({% post_url 2010-01-21-the-ruby-programming-language %}) I wrote a blog post about the book I finished reading: **The Ruby Programming Language**.

Today, five years later I find a programming language similar to Ruby that I feel is going to make a huge impact in my professional life.

Today I finished reading **[The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)** by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan and just like Ruby, I like everything about Go, the fact that tools for profiling, debugging, testing and code formatting are _bundled_ with the language, to me, is a huge bonus; not to mention the possible benefits of a clear C-like syntax and good performance.

I'm really **really** happy I found this programming language, I cannot wait to find a way to use it on the daily basis, as a matter of fact I have two personal projects, one complex called [Sentinel](https://github.com/mariocarrion/sentinel) and a simple one called [book-tracker](https://github.com/mariocarrion/book-tracker).

**book-tracker** will be my *guinea pig*, it will take some time to have something to show off, but I'll make it possible. Remember *Rome wasn't built in a day*.
