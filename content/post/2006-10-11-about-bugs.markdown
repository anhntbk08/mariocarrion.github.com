<p><em>I never put bugs in my programs[<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~newren/tutorials/developing-with-gnome/html/ch03.html#ftn.id3057343">1</a>]</em>. - Anonymous (or at least I haven't yet found <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~newren/tutorials/developing-with-gnome/html/index.html">author's name</a>) - </p>
<p>I'm very close to finish QNX to Linux porting, am preparing <em>my early adopted</em> source code to debug and improve, of course using gdb, valgrind and strace. I love squashing bugs!</p>
