<p>I still can't draw my own Dia shapes but a new partner had joined at the MonoUML team, Mario Fuentes, he is always online at #mono-hispano :). By the way, I've updated the <a href="http://monouml.sourceforge.net">MonoUML website</a>, now at least shows some information about the project. Do you want to join? Contact us! :)</p>
<p>I learned today: 'I need to wake up earlier'</p>
<p>Cheers :)
