[Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B014DUR7L2/) is a book published in 2016 by HarperBusiness and written by Chriss Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator.

**Never Split the Difference** is an interesting book with a nice pacing, it includes a collection of well narrated stories that helps you understand how some concepts were _discovered_ and how those allow you take the upper hand when negotiating. It introduces concepts like the _Framing Effect_ which indicates how people can react differently depending on how a statement is presented, the importance of listening as a practical strategy to express empathy, _mirroring and labeling_ to describe emotions.

**Never Split the Difference** is another book I should be reading at least once a year every year.
