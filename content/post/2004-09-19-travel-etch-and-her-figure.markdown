<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Travel</span></p>
<p>Yesterday I traveled to <a href="http://www.perote.gob.mx">Perote</a> pretty city but too cold for me. I spent all the day there, while I was going back to <a href="http://www.veracruz.gob.mx">Vercruz</a> in the bus, I was thinking that this two years I've traleved too much times, I've traveled to Cardel, Xico, Perote, Xalapa, Naranjos, Tuxtepec, Piedra de Amolar, Oaxaca, Cosamalopan, Coatzacoalcos, Cardenas, Paraiso; all those cities are closer to Veracruz, I like traveling. I enjoyed the spent time yesterday, rainy familial day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Etch</span></p>
<p>I was reading some post from <a href="http://www.barrapunto.com">barrapunto</a> when I found a post about <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian,</a> telling about the newest release: <span style="font-style:italic;">Sarge;</span> I'm still waiting for its releasing, I might have to wait another year more. I discovered that the new testing release will be called <span style="font-style:italic;">Etch,</span> it is the small blackboard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Her figure</span></p>
<p>I'm trying to sculpt <a href="javascript:popWin('http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/imgs/cdr.png',205,200)">my cartoon</a> with clay, it is not difficult, I've sculted the head until today, it looks really nice, her smile is pretty, I also drew her eyelashes, she will like her gift! I have a premonition!!.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I learned today</span>: 'I will start to save some money for buying one nice camera.'
