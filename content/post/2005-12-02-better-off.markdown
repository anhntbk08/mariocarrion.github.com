<p>I'm feeling better this days... I shouldn't be writing this... everytime I do it I begin feeling bad... but something says that won't happen anymore. Today I saw something kind of magical... one smile... it made me feel nice... I don't really know why... but it did.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Everyday at work I notice that documenting is very important, writing documentation <strong>must be an always-feature</strong>, documenting isn't difficult nor waste of time, it is really needed... I'm investing too much time for understanding the system... and time is a very appraised thing... but I'm doing well.</p>
<p>And... thanks to God is friday!!</p>
