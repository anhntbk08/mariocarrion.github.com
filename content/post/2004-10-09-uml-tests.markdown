<p align="justify">I've solved some UML#'s bugs and added some new graphical features, I haven't added yet the relationship feature, but it will be done sooner. Our current UML# sample is growing up, now there are 6 core classes, if we continue like this we will have our first <a href="http://monouml.sourceforge.net">MonoUML</a> release sooner, check the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/k4rny/files/lala.tar.gz">current sample</a>.</p>
