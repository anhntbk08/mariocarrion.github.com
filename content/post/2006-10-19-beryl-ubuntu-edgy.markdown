<p>I've got, finally, my nVidia GeForce 5500 video card and yesterday set it up to allow using those fancy 3D efects with <a href="http://beryl-project.org">Beryl</a>, the already-known rotating cube, shaking windows while hiding, popuping windows while showing are now working. I spend at last 3 hours setting it up, most of the problems where related to version mistmatch between nVidia Xorg modules and nVidia kernel modules, however after installing <em>-generic</em> kernel image everything seems to work.</p>
<p>I still need to set more features to Xorg to improve its performance.</p>
