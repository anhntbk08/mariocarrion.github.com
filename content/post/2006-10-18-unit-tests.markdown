  content: Just curious, why the move from QNX to Linux, and why do you think it will
    be better on Linux?

  content: "<p>I don't remember all the reasons, however I can list the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>QNX's
    future, as company, they are creating a market to embedded systems, forgeting
    about PCs, not now, but think in your future.</li>\r\n<li>We aren't using QNX'S
    RTOS capabilities, if we need any of those, we use hardware solutions instead
    of using any software one.</li>\r\n<li>No developer licence fee.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>QNX
    and Linux are quite alike, however nowadays I'm facing problems related to industrial-like
    hardware that is supported by default in QNX and isn't in Linux, you know, because
    of the kernel's freedom, however there are already implemented solutions to those
    problems, some are free some aren't. We choosed Linux due to many things, such
    as licenses, fees, plenty of samples you are able to found. So there are good
    and bad things by choosing any of this two options, we choosed Linux, also, because
    we think Linux has better future than QNX.</p>"

<p>To fix this bug that is driving me crazy I'm starting to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit Tests</a> using <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net">Check</a>, there's a lot of code to review, test and fix, but am sure in the end the this port will be better than QNX's one.</p>
<p>Now, a new entry is added to my <a href="index.php/applications-todo/">Applications TODO</a> list.</p>
