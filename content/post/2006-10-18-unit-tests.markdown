<p>To fix this bug that is driving me crazy I'm starting to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit Tests</a> using <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net">Check</a>, there's a lot of code to review, test and fix, but am sure in the end the this port will be better than QNX's one.</p>
<p>Now, a new entry is added to my <a href="index.php/applications-todo/">Applications TODO</a> list.</p>
