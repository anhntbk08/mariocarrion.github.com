<p>Today, finally, I've finished that sockets server and marshalled all the C structures to C# structures, so sending structures through sockets is a piece of cake, tomorrow will have a meeting to talk about this, and then 3 free days! Saturday and Sunday as usual, and Monday due is holiday day!</p>
<p>Let's code!</p>
