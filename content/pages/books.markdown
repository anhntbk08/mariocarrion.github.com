The following is a list of the technical and self-improvement books I've read so far, in my life. It does not include the books I read in college nor those I read in high school, because honestly I can't remember the titles.

Think of this long list as the books I willingly decided to read since I started to work professionally in **November 2005**. I keep this list as a way to keep track of my *"reading performance"* each year.

The list contains direct links to the places where you could buy the books at the time I added the link, so be aware, those links could be dead by now. The links **are not** affiliate links, just plain old normal links.

All the books are sorted from the most recent read to the least recent.
