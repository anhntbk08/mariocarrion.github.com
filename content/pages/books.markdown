This is list of all the books I've read so far, including technical and self-improvement. It does not include the books I read in college nor those I read in high school, because honestly I can't remember the titles.

It includes all the books I decided to read since I started to work professionally back in **November 2005**. I use this list as a way to keep track of my *"yearly reading performance"*. The list items are either linking to my personal posts describing the book or links to the places where you could buy the books, be aware the external links could be dead by now.

This list is to remind me every year **I must strive to increase the number of finished books**.
