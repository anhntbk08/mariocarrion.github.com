My name is **Mario Carrion** and I'm a Software Engineer who specializes in designing and implementing **Software Architectures**, my *forte* is: APIs and Distributed Real Time-based Computer Systems.

I'm a hands-on Engineer, I could be a Technical Lead Engineer that manages, motivates and mentors other juniors engineers and at the same time I could be your Senior Engineer who likes getting *dirty* spending time writing, profiling and testing software. I fear no technology, new or legacy.

I can assure for sure one thing: with enough time I'm able to deliver the best software **anyone** dreamed of, not only the one that performs the best under heavy usage, but the one that is written with the best software practices, specially a software aiming to have a 100% code coverage, that in the end not only will work now **but will allow anyone else to improve it in the future**.

Officially, I have a Bachelor's Degree in **Computer Systems Engineering** with a Major in **Relational Databases**, from the **[Instituto Tecnologico de Veracruz](http://www.itver.edu.mx/)** in Mexico (I bet you never heard of this college).

So, I know for sure Mathematics, Electronics, Computer Hardware and Computer Software Development, among other things.

All that being said, let me tell you *my story...*

I became interested in computers when I was in Junior High, I was lucky enough to own an 80486 PC, this computer allowed me to create new stuff, from silly HTML pages hosted on Geocities to much more *complex* C programs that asked you to input your age and name.

I used this PC for a long time and I had the pleasure of installing Linux on it, Red Hat and [Corel Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corel_Linux) to be precise, it was difficult in the beginning but really educational, as a matter of fact, this *Linux fixation* led me to get involved in Open Source, that in the end allowed me to land a job at [Novell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell) in the really pretty and quiet [Cambridge, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts). (**Best job ever**)

From there, I became what I'm now: **Mario, Distinguished Engineer**, the one that is always learning new stuff and the one that is always looking forward to facing new challenges.
