{{< tweet 958031606073249792 >}}

I'm a **Computer Systems Engineer** with more than 15 years of professional Software Engineering and Software Development experience, I specialize in Architecting and Implementing Performant **Real Time Scalable Web Services**.

I'm a hands-on Engineer with manager experience mentoring junior engineers and coordinating work with distributed teams across multiple time zones. Although I prefer working on [Go](https://golang.org/)/[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)-based systems, I fear no technology whatsoever, new or "_legacy_".

I assure one thing: with enough time and human resources I will be able to deliver the best software **anyone** dreamed of, not only the one that performs the best under heavy load, but also the one that is written with the best Software Development practices, that will be delivered when the deadline is reached and **will allow anyone else to improve it in the future**.

Officially, I have a Bachelor's Degree in **Computer Systems Engineering** with a Major in **Relational Databases**, from the **[Instituto Tecnologico de Veracruz](http://www.itver.edu.mx/)** in Mexico (I bet you never heard of this college).
