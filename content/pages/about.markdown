{{< tweet 958031606073249792 >}}

I'm a **Computer Systems Engineer** with more than 15 years of professional Software Engineering and Software Development experience, I specialize in **Architecting** and **Implementing** Performant Real Time **Scalable Web Services**.

As a hands-on Backend Engineer and Technical Leader I've been lucky enough to manage, mentor and guide junior and experienced engineers, both collocated as well as distributed across multiple timezones; and in recent years I've been focused on using **Go** for building Web-based enterprise systems, using REST and gRPC.

During my career I've been able to work in different industries, delivering different types of production software, ranging from Real Time Automation Control Systems to Linux Accessibility APIs to Enterprise Advertising Web Applications.
